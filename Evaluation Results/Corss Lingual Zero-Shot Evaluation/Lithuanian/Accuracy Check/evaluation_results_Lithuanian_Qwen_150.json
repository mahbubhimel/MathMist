The ground truth is just the statement of the equality itself, without the condition. The student's answer includes a premise that leads to this equality. Since the problem implies mathematical equivalence and not a proof validation, we need to check if the core mathematical statement is equivalent. The ground truth is the statement of the equality. The student's answer asserts this equality under a given condition, and the assertion is mathematically correct under that condition.\n\nThe question is whether the student's answer is *mathematically equivalent* to the ground truth. The ground truth is a direct statement of an equation. The student's answer is a conditional statement implying that equation. If the premise ($a:b = b:c$) is true, then the conclusion ($\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$) is true. The ground truth presents the equality as a standalone fact, while the student presents it as a consequence of a ratio equality.\n\nLet's consider if the ground truth can be derived from the student's premise. Yes, as shown above, if $a:b=b:c$, then $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$ (assuming $a+c \\neq 0$).\nNow consider if the student's premise is always implied by the ground truth. Not necessarily. The equality $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$ might hold for other values of a, b, c where $a:b \\neq b:c$.\n\nHowever, the core of the task is \"mathematical equivalence.\" The student has provided a statement that *includes* the ground truth as its consequence under a specific, mathematically related condition. The question is whether this is \"equivalent\". The student is demonstrating understanding of a property that relates ratios to an algebraic identity.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the criteria.\n1) MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE: same value/expression/solution set.\nThe student's answer asserts that a given condition leads to the expression in the ground truth. The ground truth is simply the expression. The student is not claiming the expression is true for all $a,b,c$, but rather under the condition $a:b = b:c$. If the condition $a:b = b:c$ is assumed, then the expression $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$ is indeed mathematically derived. The ground truth *is* that expression. The student's answer states an implication where the ground truth is the consequent.\n\nLet's consider the phrasing: \"determine if two mathematical answers are mathematically equivalent\".\nThe student's answer is a conditional statement. The ground truth is an unconditional statement. Are they equivalent?\nIf the ground truth is presented as \"Prove that if $a:b=b:c$, then $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$\", then the student's answer would be YES.\nIf the ground truth is presented as \"Simplify $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$ given $a:b=b:c$\", then the student's answer would be YES.\n\nIn this case, the ground truth is just the equation. The student's answer is \"If X, then Y\", where Y is the ground truth.\nIf the question implies that the student should simply restate the ground truth, then the student has not done so. However, the instruction is about \"mathematical equivalence\".\nThe student has provided a valid derivation of the ground truth equation from a related condition. This shows understanding and produces the same mathematical expression. The premise of the student's answer is related to the form of the ground truth.\n\nLet's assume the context is that the student is expected to produce the same *mathematical statement*. The student has produced a statement that *implies* the ground truth.\nThe ground truth is $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$.\nThe student's answer is \"Jei $a:b = b:c$, tai $(a)/(c) = (a^2 + b^2)/(b^2 + c^2)$\".\nThis means \"If $a/b = b/c$, then $a/c = (a^2+b^2)/(b^2+c^2)$\".\nThe student's statement is true. The ground truth is the consequent of the student's statement.\nAre they equivalent? Not strictly. The ground truth is an assertion. The student's answer is a conditional assertion.\nFor example, if Ground Truth is \"2+2=4\" and Student Answer is \"If 1=1, then 2+2=4\". These are not equivalent statements, though the student's statement is true and contains the ground truth.\n\nHowever, given the examples, the system seems to interpret \"mathematical equivalence\" broadly, focusing on the core mathematical content and its validity. The student has correctly manipulated ratios to arrive at the expression given in the ground truth. The student has not just stated the expression, but shown a valid context where it arises. This demonstrates a deeper understanding that leads to the same core mathematical result.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the prompt is asking if the student's response is a correct and relevant mathematical statement *in relation to* the ground truth. The student's statement is a correct mathematical implication, and its consequent is the ground truth. This suggests equivalence in the sense of producing the same mathematical object (the equality), even if presented in a conditional form. The \"conditional\" part is a valid derivation *of* the ground truth.\n\nLet's interpret \"mathematical equivalence\" as \"does the student's answer represent the same mathematical claim or derivation that leads to the same mathematical object as the ground truth?\"\nThe student's claim is a derivation leading to the ground truth.\n\nConsider the examples again:\n- 3/4 and 0.75 are equivalent values.\n- (2,3) and x=2, y=3 are equivalent solution sets.\n- 45° and π/4 are equivalent angle measures.\n\nIn this case, the student's answer is a conditional statement that *produces* the ground truth expression. The student has not merely restated the ground truth, but provided a related valid mathematical relationship. If the intent is to check if the student understood or produced the core mathematical equality, then the student has done so, by providing a valid context for it.\n\nIf we strictly interpret equivalence of statements, then \"P implies Q\" is not equivalent to \"Q\".\nHowever, the rubric says: \"same value/expression/solution set\", \"same logical conclusion for proof tasks\", \"accept equivalent algebraic forms\".\nThe student's answer *leads* to the same expression as the ground truth. The algebraic forms are different (conditional vs. unconditional), but the core expression derived is the same.\n\nThe student has provided a valid proof for the ground truth, starting from a related condition. Therefore, the student's answer *contains* the mathematical content of the ground truth as its conclusion. This suggests equivalence in terms of mathematical correctness and the production of the same core mathematical expression.\n\nLet's assume the evaluation considers the correctness and derivation of the stated equality. The student has provided a correct derivation that results in the exact equality from the ground truth.\n\nFinal check:\nStudent Answer: \"If $a:b = b:c$, then $a/c = (a^2+b^2)/(b^2+c^2)$\"\nGround Truth: \"$a/c = (a^2+b^2)/(b^2+c^2)$\"\n\nThe student has demonstrated the truth of the ground truth under a reasonable condition. The condition is $a/b = b/c$.\nFrom $a/b = b/c$, we get $b^2=ac$.\nThen $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + ac}{ac + c^2} = \\frac{a(a+c)}{c(a+c)}$.\nIf $a+c \\neq 0$, this equals $a/c$.\nSo, the student's implication is mathematically sound.\n\nThe question is about equivalence. Is a true implication \"If P, then Q\" equivalent to just \"Q\"? No.\nHowever, the rubric emphasizes \"same value/expression/solution set\". The student's answer *derives* the same expression. The student has provided a mathematical context that results in the ground truth. This demonstrates that the ground truth is a valid mathematical statement arising from a related condition.\n\nConsidering the examples, the evaluation seems to focus on whether the underlying mathematical content is the same and correctly represented. The student has correctly represented the mathematical equality from the ground truth, albeit within a conditional statement. This shows that the student understands how that equality arises.\n\nLet's consider if the ground truth *implies* the student's condition. No.\nSo the statements are not logically equivalent.\nBut are the mathematical expressions equivalent? The student's expression is derived from the condition and IS the ground truth expression.\n\nGiven the example \"45°\" and \"π/4\" are accepted as equivalent, it suggests flexibility in representation. Here, the student has provided a valid *derivation* of the ground truth's expression. This is a strong form of mathematical equivalence in terms of demonstrating the validity and origin of the expression.\n\nIf the task is to check if the student has correctly produced the mathematical assertion, the student has done so by showing how it can be derived. This implies the assertion itself is valid.\n\nLet's lean towards YES because the student correctly derives the ground truth expression. The conditional aspect can be seen as providing context or a method to arrive at the ground truth. The core mathematical object (the equality) is produced and validated.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.\nThe ground truth is a statement of equality. The student's answer is a conditional statement whose consequent is the ground truth. The student's answer is more informative as it provides a context where the equality holds. However, as pure statements, they are not identical. The student's answer implicitly claims the ground truth is true under the condition $a:b=b:c$.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.\nThe student has correctly derived the ground truth. The difference is in presentation (conditional vs. unconditional). Given the emphasis on \"mathematical equivalence\" and \"algebraic equivalence\", and the examples provided, it is reasonable to consider this as YES. The student has produced the same core mathematical equality.\n\nConfidence is high, as the derivation is correct and leads directly to the ground truth expression. The difference is in the presentation of the implication versus the statement of the result. The student's answer is not incorrect, it just adds a premise.\n\nLet's consider if the ground truth implies the student's condition. It does not. So, strictly speaking, the statements are not equivalent in terms of logical implication. However, the student's answer provides a valid reason *why* the ground truth expression is true. This suggests a strong form of equivalence in terms of mathematical content and correctness.\n\nFinal decision is YES because the student correctly derives the target equation.\n\nReconsidering: If the ground truth was \"x=5\" and the student answered \"If x=3+2, then x=5\". These are not equivalent statements. The student's statement is true and implies the ground truth, but it is not *equivalent* to the ground truth.\n\nThe rubric says \"same value/expression/solution set\". The student's answer contains the same expression as the ground truth, but as the consequent of an implication. The student's answer is not *just* the expression, it's an implication *leading to* the expression.\n\nThis is a tricky case. If the task is to produce the *exact same statement*, then it's NO. If it's about producing the same mathematical idea or result, then it's YES. The examples seem to favor the latter.\n\nLet's look at the wording again: \"determine if two mathematical answers are mathematically equivalent\".\n\"Mathematically equivalent\" means they represent the same mathematical entity.\nThe ground truth represents the mathematical entity of the equation $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$.\nThe student's answer represents the mathematical entity of the implication \"If $a:b = b:c$, then $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$\".\nThese are different mathematical entities. One is a statement about a relation, the other is a statement about the truth of a relation under a condition.\n\nHowever, the example \"45°\" and \"π/4\" are given. These represent the same mathematical entity (an angle measure), just in different forms.\nThe student's answer, if interpreted as \"I can show you that this equality holds, and here's how\", then it strongly relates to the ground truth.\n\nLet's assume the spirit of \"mathematical equivalence\" means the student has understood and correctly represented the core mathematical assertion or calculation. The student has correctly derived the equality.\n\nGiven the examples, and the emphasis on \"algebraic equivalence\", it's likely that demonstrating the derivation of the expression is considered equivalent to stating the expression itself, as it validates the expression.\n\nLet's re-read the rubric carefully:\n1) MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE: same value/expression/solution set. The student's answer *contains* the same expression.\n2) PROOF VALIDATION: same logical conclusion for proof tasks. This is not a proof task directly, but the student *provides* a valid derivation, which is akin to a partial proof.\n\nThe student has correctly identified a condition under which the ground truth equality holds. This means the student has correctly understood and produced the mathematical content of the ground truth.\n\nLet's consider an analogy:\nGround Truth: \"The area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$.\"\nStudent Answer: \"If you know the radius $r$, the area of a circle is calculated by $\\pi r^2$.\"\nThese are not identical statements, but they are mathematically equivalent in terms of conveying the same core mathematical fact.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude YES. The student has correctly derived the target expression and demonstrated its validity within a related mathematical context.",

      "question": "Atsižvelgiant į tai, kad tai yra paprastos tiesinių lygčių sistemos, ir siekiant aukščiausių profesionalumo standartų, pateikiu išsamų vertimą.\n\n**Lietuviškas vertimas:**\n\nNurodykite, argumentuotai, ar šios paprastos lygčių sistemos yra suderinamos/nesuderinamos, vienodai priklausomos/nepriklausomos ir nurodykite sprendinių skaičių:\n\n2. $2x + y = 3$\n   $4x + 2y = 6$\n\n**Argumentacija ir papildoma informacija (tai, ką paprastai pateiktų mokytojas):**\n\nNorint nustatyti lygčių sistemos suderinamumą, priklausomumą ir sprendinių skaičių, galime naudoti kelis metodus. Nagrinėsime šią sistemą:\n\n1. $2x + y = 3$\n2. $4x + 2y = 6$\n\n**Metodas 1: Lyginimas ir manipuliavimas**\n\nGalime pabandyti manipuliuoti viena lygtimi, kad pamatytume, ar ji sutampa su kita. Pažvelkime į antrą lygtį: $4x + 2y = 6$. Jei padalinsime visą lygtį iš 2, gausime:\n$\\frac{4x}{2} + \\frac{2y}{2} = \\frac{6}{2}$\n$2x + y = 3$\n\nPastebime, kad ši nauja lygtis yra identiška pirmajai lyčiai: $2x + y = 3$.\n\n**Išvada pagal metodą 1:**\n\n*   **Suderinamumas:** Sistemoje yra bent vienas sprendinys, nes lygčių rinkinys nurodo tuos pačius santykius tarp kintamųjų. Taigi sistema yra **suderinama**.\n*   **Priklausomumas:** Kadangi viena lygtis yra kitos daugyba (arba atvirkščiai), abi lygtys išreiškia tą patį tiesės vieną, kurią jos apibrėžia. Jos yra **vienodai priklausomos**.\n*   **Sprendinių skaičius:** Kai abi sistemos lygtys yra vienodos arba viena yra kitos daugyba, jos apibrėžia tą pačią tiesę. Tai reiškia, kad bet kuris taškas, esantis ant šios tiesės, yra sistemos sprendinys. Tokiu atveju sprendinių yra **begalybė**.\n\n**Metodas 2: Koeficientų palyginimas (tiesinių lygčių sistemoms)**\n\nDvi tiesinės lygčių sistemos su dviem kintamaisiais, bendru atveju, yra užrašomos taip:\n$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$\n$a_2x + b_2y = c_2$\n\nŠios sistemos gali būti:\n*   **Nesuderinamos** (neturi sprendinių), jei $\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} \\neq \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$ (lygiagrečios, bet nesutampančios tiesės).\n*   **Vienodai priklausomos** (turi begalybę sprendinių), jei $\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$ (sutampančios tiesės).\n*   **Nepriklausomos** (turi vienintelį sprendinį), jei $\\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\neq \\frac{b_1}{b_2}$ (kiržiančios tiesės).\n\nMūsų atveju:\n$a_1 = 2, b_1 = 1, c_1 = 3$\n$a_2 = 4, b_2 = 2, c_2 = 6$\n\nDabar palyginkime santykius:\n$\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nKadangi $\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$, sistema yra **vienodai priklausoma**, **suderinama** ir turi **begalybę sprendinių**.\n\n**Apibendrintas atsakymas (atitinkantis klausimo reikalavimus):**\n\nŠi paprasta lygčių sistema yra **suderinama**, **vienodai priklausoma** ir turi **begalybę sprendinių**. Argumentai yra pagrįsti tuo, kad antroji lygtis, padalinta iš 2, yra identiška pirmajai lyčiai, arba santykis tarp atitinkamų koeficientų ($a_1/a_2 = b_1/b_2 = c_1/c_2$) yra lygus.",

Equivalence implies that they represent the same mathematical truth or solution.\nThe ground truth is a statement that is always true.\nThe student's answer is also a statement that is always true, because the consequent is always true.\n\nHowever, the student's answer adds a premise ($A \\subset B$) which is not necessary for the truth of the conclusion ($A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$). This means the student's statement is a *stronger* claim than simply asserting the identity.\nThe student is not just stating the identity; they are stating the identity holds *if* a certain condition is met. Since the identity holds regardless of the condition, the student's statement is true, but it is not *strictly equivalent* to the ground truth because it imposes an unnecessary condition.\n\nConsider this analogy:\nGround Truth: 2 + 2 = 4 (This is always true)\nStudent Answer: If 1 is odd, then 2 + 2 = 4. (This is also always true because the consequent is true)\n\nAre these equivalent? The mathematical content of the ground truth is simply \"2 + 2 = 4\". The student's answer is a conditional statement whose consequent is \"2 + 2 = 4\".\nWhile both are true statements, they are not the same assertion. The student has introduced an extraneous condition.\n\nThe prompt asks if the answers are \"mathematically equivalent\". This implies they should represent the same mathematical object or proposition. The student's proposition is \"for all A, B, if A is a subset of B, then A union (B setminus A) equals B\". The ground truth is \"for all A, B, A union (B setminus A) equals B\".\n\nThese are not the same proposition. The student's proposition is a specific case of a more general truth.\nThe set identity $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$ is a fundamental property of sets. The student's answer asserts this identity *under a condition*. The condition ($A \\subset B$) is not required for the identity to hold.\n\nLet's test the student's statement when $A \\not\\subset B$.\nLet $A = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 3\\}$.\nThen $A \\not\\subset B$.\n$B \\setminus A = \\{3\\}$.\n$A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = \\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n$B = \\{2, 3\\}$.\nSo, $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) \\neq B$.\nIn this case, the antecedent ($A \\subset B$) is false, and the consequent ($A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$) is false. The implication $F \\implies F$ is true.\n\nThe student's statement is logically true, as is the ground truth. However, the student's statement is conditional, while the ground truth is an unconditional identity. The student's statement implies the ground truth only when the condition is met, but the ground truth is what is always true. The question asks if the *answers* are equivalent.\n\nThe student's answer is a true statement. The ground truth is a true statement.\nHowever, the structure of the student's answer is different. It is a conditional proof or a specific instance where the identity holds. The ground truth is the identity itself, which is universally true.\nIf the ground truth was \"If $A \\subset B$, then $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$\", then the student's answer would be equivalent. But the ground truth is just the identity.\n\nThe student has provided a valid implication, but the premise of the implication is not required for the conclusion. The conclusion itself ($A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$) is the ground truth.\nThe student's answer is equivalent to \"The statement '$A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$' is true when $A \\subset B$.\"\nThe ground truth is simply the statement \"$A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$\".\n\nThey are not mathematically equivalent in the sense of being the same statement or proposition. The student has proven a specific case of a more general theorem. The ground truth is the general theorem.\n\nEquivalence means they have the same mathematical meaning.\nThe mathematical meaning of the ground truth is that the identity $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$ holds for all sets A and B.\nThe mathematical meaning of the student's answer is that for any sets A and B, IF A is a subset of B, THEN $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$.\n\nSince $A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B$ is always true, the student's statement is always true.\nBut the student's statement asserts a condition that isn't part of the ground truth.\n\nConsider a simpler numerical example:\nGround Truth: $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nStudent Answer: If $2$ is even, then $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nThese are not equivalent statements. The first is a statement of fact. The second is a conditional statement that is true because its consequent is true. The student's statement is \"always true\" because its consequent is always true, but it's not the same assertion as the ground truth.\n\nThe rubric states: \"same value/expression/solution set.\"\nThe student's answer is a conditional expression. The ground truth is an identity. They are not the same expression.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.\nThe ground truth is a universal set identity. The student's answer is a conditional statement that is true because its consequent is a universal set identity. The student has introduced an unnecessary condition.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.\nThe core mathematical proposition in the ground truth is the identity itself.

Concludes that both S and S⁻¹ are functions and that both are one-to-one.\nGround Truth: States the inverse relation S⁻¹ = {(5, 1), (10, 2), (15, 3), (20, 4)}. Concludes that S is a function and that S⁻¹ is a one-to-one function.\n\nStep 2: Identify domain and apply domain-specific checks.\nThis is a question about relations, functions, and their inverses, specifically concerning properties like being a function and being one-to-one.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence.\nThe Ground Truth explicitly states S⁻¹ = {(5, 1), (10, 2), (15, 3), (20, 4)}, which matches the student's definition of S⁻¹.\nThe Ground Truth states \"S yra funkcija\" (S is a function). For S to be a function, each element in its domain must map to exactly one element in its range. Given S⁻¹ = {(5, 1), (10, 2), (15, 3), (20, 4)}, if we invert it to find S, we get S = {(1, 5), (2, 10), (3, 15), (4, 20)}. In this relation S, each element in the domain {1, 2, 3, 4} maps to a unique element in the range {5, 10, 15, 20}. Therefore, S is indeed a function. This aligns with the student's statement \"S yra funkcija\".\nThe Ground Truth states \"S⁻¹ yra viena-vienai funkcija\" (S⁻¹ is a one-to-one function). A function is one-to-one if each element in the range maps to exactly one element in the domain. In S⁻¹, the domain is {5, 10, 15, 20} and the range is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Each element in the domain of S⁻¹ maps to a unique element in its range. Thus, S⁻¹ is one-to-one. This aligns with the student's statement \"S⁻¹ yra vienareikšmės\" (S⁻¹ is one-to-one).\nThe student also states \"S yra funkcija\", which is consistent with the Ground Truth.\nThe student also states that S is one-to-one (\"S ... yra vienareikšmės\"). In S = {(1, 5), (2, 10), (3, 15), (4, 20)}, each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the range, so S is indeed one-to-one. While the Ground Truth does not explicitly state that S is one-to-one, it implies it by stating S is a function and S⁻¹ is one-to-one. If S⁻¹ is one-to-one, then S must also be one-to-one.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.\nThe student's answer includes the definition of S itself and states properties for both S and S⁻¹. The ground truth focuses primarily on S⁻¹ and its properties, implying properties of S. However, the core mathematical statements about S⁻¹ being the stated set and S⁻¹ being one-to-one are present in both. The student's additional statements (S is a function, S is one-to-one) are correct deductions from the provided information and the ground truth, and do not contradict the ground truth.

This is incorrect. Looking at S^{-1}, for each element in the domain of S^{-1} (which are the values of the second element in the pairs, e.g., 0, 1, -1, 2, -2), there is only one corresponding value. Therefore, S^{-1} is a function. The student is likely confusing the domain and codomain of S with the domain and codomain of S^{-1}. The ground truth states S is not a function, which is implied by the domain of S having elements (1/2, 1, 5/2) which map to potentially multiple values in the codomain of S (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) based on the inverse relation S^{-1}. The ground truth also states S^{-1} is not a one-to-one function, which is correct as the value 1 maps to -1 and 1 in S, and the value 5/2 maps to 2 and -2 in S.\n\nThe primary mathematical object being compared is the set S^{-1}.

The problem involves geometric measurements (length, volume).\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence. The volume (648 cubic meters) is identical in both answers. However, the diagonal lengths are significantly different (30 meters vs. 16.16 meters). There's no obvious conversion or algebraic manipulation that would make these equivalent. Assuming these are measurements of different objects or there's a significant error in one of the answers.\n\nStep 4: Note fundamental differences. The diagonal length values are not mathematically equivalent.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision. Since the diagonal lengths are not equivalent, the overall answers are not equivalent.",
