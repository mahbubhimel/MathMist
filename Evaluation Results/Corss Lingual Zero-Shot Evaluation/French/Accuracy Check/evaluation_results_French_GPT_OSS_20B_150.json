The ground truth has $-2cazx$. These are equivalent.\nThe student has $+2bcyz$. The ground truth has $+2bcyz$. These are equivalent.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the signs.\nThe expansion of $(X+Y+Z)^2$ is $X^2+Y^2+Z^2+2XY+2XZ+2YZ$.\nHere $X=ax$, $Y=-by$, $Z=-cz$.\n$X^2 = (ax)^2 = a^2x^2$\n$Y^2 = (-by)^2 = b^2y^2$\n$Z^2 = (-cz)^2 = c^2z^2$\n$2XY = 2(ax)(-by) = -2abxy$\n$2XZ = 2(ax)(-cz) = -2acxz$\n$2YZ = 2(-by)(-cz) = +2bcyz$\n\nSo the correct expansion is $a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 - 2abxy - 2acxz + 2bcyz$.\n\nStudent Answer: $a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 - 2abxy - 2acxz + 2bcyz$.\nThis matches the correct expansion perfectly.\n\nGround Truth: $a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 - 2abxy + 2bcyz - 2cazx$.\n\nComparing Student Answer and Ground Truth:\nStudent has $-2acxz$. Ground truth has $-2cazx$. These are algebraically equivalent.\nStudent has $+2bcyz$. Ground truth has $+2bcyz$. These are equivalent.\n\nThe difference is that the student's answer lists the terms as:\n$a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 - 2abxy - 2acxz + 2bcyz$\n\nAnd the ground truth lists the terms as:\n$a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 - 2abxy + 2bcyz - 2cazx$\n\nThe terms are:\nTerm 1: $a^2x^2$ (Match)\nTerm 2: $b^2y^2$ (Match)\nTerm 3: $c^2z^2$ (Match)\nTerm 4: $-2abxy$ (Match)\nTerm 5: $-2acxz$ (Student) vs $-2cazx$ (Ground Truth). These are algebraically equivalent.\nTerm 6: $+2bcyz$ (Student) vs $+2bcyz$ (Ground Truth). These are equivalent.\n\nIt appears the ground truth has the order of the last two cross terms swapped, and the variable order in one of them is different but still equivalent.\nThe student's answer is correct. The ground truth is also correct, just with different ordering and variable order for one term.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer IS mathematically equivalent to the ground truth.\nThe student's answer uses the order $-2acxz$ for the term $2(ax)(-cz)$, and the ground truth uses $-2cazx$ for the same term. These are algebraically equivalent.\nThe student's answer uses $+2bcyz$ for the term $2(-by)(-cz)$, and the ground truth uses $+2bcyz$.

If this premise holds, then the equation \\(b^4 = a^2c^2\\) is always true because \\((ac)^2 = b^4\\), which means \\((b^2)^2 = b^4\\).\nTherefore, if \\(ac = b^2\\), then \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{ac}{c^2} = \\frac{a}{c}\\).\nSo, the student correctly derived \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\).\n\nThe crucial step is whether \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\) given \\(ac=b^2\\).\nAs shown above, \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\) only if \\(b^4 = a^2c^2\\), which is true if \\(ac=b^2\\).\nLet's re-examine the student's final statement: \\((a)/(c)=\\frac{b^{2}}{c^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{b^{2}+c^{2}}\\).\nThe student is asserting that all three parts are equal.\nFrom \\(a:b = b:c\\), we have \\(ac = b^2\\).\nSo, \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\). This part is correct.\nThe student then states \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\).\nThis implies \\(\\frac{ac}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2+ac}{ac+c^2}\\).\n\\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a(a+c)}{c(a+c)}\\).\nThis simplifies to \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a}{c}\\), provided that \\(a+c \\neq 0\\).\n\nLet's verify the step: \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\).\nSubstitute \\(b^2 = ac\\):\n\\(\\frac{ac}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + ac}{ac + c^2}\\)\n\\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a(a+c)}{c(a+c)}\\)\nThis equation holds if \\(a+c \\neq 0\\).\nThus, the student's derivation implies that if \\(ac=b^2\\), then \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\).\n\nThe ground truth is \\(\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\).\nThe student's derivation from \\(a:b = b:c\\) leads to \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\).\nThe student then makes the leap \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\).\nThis leap is algebraically sound as shown above, given the initial premise \\(ac=b^2\\).\nThe student has indeed shown that \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\) under the condition \\(ac=b^2\\).\nThe student's final written expression states that \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\) and that \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\). By transitivity, this means \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\).\n\nLet's verify the equality \\(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2} = \\frac{a}{c}\\) given \\(ac = b^2\\).\nSubstitute \\(b^2 = ac\\) into the left side:\n\\(\\frac{a^2 + ac}{ac + c^2}\\)\nFactor out 'a' from the numerator and 'c' from the denominator:\n\\(\\frac{a(a+c)}{c(a+c)}\\)\nIf \\(a+c \\neq 0\\), this simplifies to \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\).\n\nSo, under the condition \\(ac = b^2\\), the equality \\(\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}\\) holds, assuming \\(a+c \\neq 0\\).\nThe student's intermediate step \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}\\) is algebraically equivalent to \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\) if \\(ac=b^2\\).\nThe student's final statement \\(\\frac{b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2+c^2}\\) is also derived correctly from \\(ac=b^2\\).\nTherefore, the student's derivation leads to the ground truth equation.\n\nThe student's answer uses French for the introductory phrase \"En utilisant\".

A unique solution exists if $a_1/a_2 \\neq b_1/b_2$. The ground truth calculates $3/9 = 1/3$ and $2/-6 = -1/3$. Since $1/3 \\neq -1/3$, the condition for a unique solution is met. The ground truth also states the system is consistent and mutually independent, which is also implied by the condition for a unique solution. The student answer confirms consistency, independence, and a unique solution (0,0). While the ground truth does not explicitly state (0,0) as the solution, the mathematical conditions derived in the ground truth (consistency, independence, unique solution) align perfectly with the student's conclusion. If a system of linear equations is consistent, independent, and has a unique solution, that solution is determined by the specific equations. The problem statement does not provide the equations themselves, only the comparison of coefficients used in the ground truth to establish the nature of the solution. Given the information, both answers point to the same outcome: a system with a single, unique solution, and the system itself is consistent and independent. The specific solution (0,0) provided by the student is a plausible outcome for a consistent and independent system, and the ground truth's reasoning supports the existence of such a unique solution without specifying its coordinates.

The task is to verify the equivalence of two set expressions.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence.\nLet \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\). This means \\(x \\in A\\) or \\(x \\in (B \\setminus A)\\).\nIf \\(x \\in A\\), then \\(x \\in B\\) is not necessarily true (as A is not necessarily a subset of B).\nHowever, the student's explanation states: \"chaque élément de B appartient à A ou à B∖A, donc à leur union, et l’union ne contient aucun élément hors de B\". This explanation implies a misunderstanding or an unstated assumption.\n\nLet's verify the identity \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) generally.\nLet \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\). This means \\(x \\in A\\) or \\(x \\in (B \\setminus A)\\).\nIf \\(x \\in A\\), \\(x\\) could be in \\(A\\) but not in \\(B\\). For example, if \\(A = \\{1, 2\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{2, 3\\}\\), then \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = \\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), which is not equal to \\(B = \\{2, 3\\}\\).\nThe statement \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) is not universally true.\n\nLet's consider the student's reasoning in French: \"chaque élément de B appartient à A ou à B∖A\". This premise is incorrect. An element \\(x \\in B\\) does not necessarily belong to \\(A\\) or \\(B \\setminus A\\). If \\(x \\in B\\) and \\(x \\notin A\\), then \\(x \\in B \\setminus A\\). If \\(x \\in B\\) and \\(x \\in A\\), then \\(x \\in A\\). So, indeed, if \\(x \\in B\\), then \\(x \\in A\\) or \\(x \\in B \\setminus A\\). This part of the student's reasoning is correct.\nThe next part: \"donc à leur union\". This is correct as well: if \\(x \\in A\\) or \\(x \\in B \\setminus A\\), then \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\).\nThe final part: \"et l’union ne contient aucun élément hors de B, d’où \\(A\\cup(B\\setminus A)=B\\)\". This is where the error lies. The union \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\) *can* contain elements outside of B. Specifically, elements that are in A but not in B.\n\nLet's analyze \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\) more rigorously.\nWe want to check if \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) is true.\n\nConsider an element \\(x\\).\nCase 1: \\(x \\in B\\).\n   If \\(x \\in A\\), then \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\).\n   If \\(x \\notin A\\), then \\(x \\in B \\setminus A\\), so \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\).\n   Thus, if \\(x \\in B\\), then \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\). This shows \\(B \\subseteq A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\).\n\nCase 2: \\(x \\notin B\\).\n   If \\(x \\in A\\), then \\(x\\) is in \\(A\\), but not in \\(B\\setminus A\\) (since \\(B \\setminus A\\) only contains elements from \\(B\\)). So \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\).\n   In this case, \\(x \\notin B\\), but \\(x \\in A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\). This shows that \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\) can contain elements not in \\(B\\).\n   Therefore, \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A)\\) is not generally equal to \\(B\\).\n\nThe statement \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) is only true if \\(A \\subseteq B\\).\n\nThe ground truth states the identity \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\). This identity is false in general set theory.\nThe student's answer attempts to prove this false identity, and their reasoning contains a flaw.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences.\nThe fundamental difference is that the equality \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) is not a universally true identity in set theory, and both the ground truth and the student's answer assert its truth. The student's justification for this incorrect identity is also flawed.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision.\nSince the ground truth itself represents a mathematical statement that is not universally true, and the student's answer is also based on this incorrect premise, they are \"equivalent\" in the sense that they both state and attempt to justify a false proposition. However, in terms of mathematical correctness, both are incorrect. If the task is to check if the student's conclusion matches the ground truth *as written*, then they match. But the core of the evaluation is mathematical equivalence of *correct* mathematical statements. Given that the ground truth is a false statement, we are evaluating if the student arrived at that same false statement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the rubric: \"same value/expression/solution set\". The expression is the set equality. Both the student and the ground truth present the same expression: \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\). The student also provides a reasoning.\n\nThe prompt is about \"mathematical equivalence\". If the ground truth is false, can it be mathematically equivalent to a student's answer that is also false in the same way? Yes, if they assert the same false statement.\n\nLet's assume the intent of the question is to check if the student's final assertion matches the ground truth's assertion.\nStudent Assertion: \\(A\\cup(B\\setminus A)=B\\)\nGround Truth Assertion: \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\)\nThese are the same mathematical statements.\n\nHowever, the evaluation criteria state:\n1) MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE: same value/expression/solution set.\nThe expression is the same. Is it mathematically equivalent in terms of truth value? No, because the statement itself is false.\n\nLet's consider the example:\nStudent Answer: 3/4\nGround Truth: 0.75\nAnalysis: Converting fraction to decimal: 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75. Both represent the same mathematical value.\n\nHere, \"mathematical value\" refers to the numerical value that is correct.\n\nIf the ground truth was, for example, \"Prove that \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\) if and only if \\(A \\subseteq B\\)\", and the student concluded the same, then it would be YES.\n\nHere, the ground truth is presented as a statement to be proven or accepted as true. The student also accepts it as true and provides a (flawed) proof.\n\nGiven the context of mathematical evaluation, if the ground truth is a universally false statement, and the student also arrives at that same false statement, they are expressing the same incorrect mathematical assertion. This could be considered equivalent in terms of reaching the same \"conclusion\".\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE\" implies that the underlying mathematical truth or value should be the same. If the ground truth is not mathematically sound, then asserting equivalence is tricky.\n\nLet's interpret \"mathematical equivalence\" as \"presenting the same mathematical proposition\". In this case, the student has presented the same proposition as the ground truth.\n\nThe student's reasoning is flawed, but the final conclusion matches the ground truth.\nThe prompt asks if the \"answers\" are mathematically equivalent. The answer includes the conclusion and the reasoning.\n\nIf the ground truth were correct, and the student arrived at the same correct conclusion, then it would be YES.\nIf the ground truth were correct, and the student arrived at a different correct conclusion, it would be YES if they represent the same mathematical value/expression.\nIf the ground truth were correct, and the student arrived at an incorrect conclusion, it would be NO.\n\nHere, the ground truth is incorrect.\nThe student's answer is: a statement \\(A\\cup(B\\setminus A)=B\\) and a justification.\nThe ground truth is: a statement \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\).\n\nThe core mathematical expression asserted by both is identical.\nThe criteria mentions \"same value/expression/solution set\". The expression here is the identity.\n\nIf the ground truth was \"2+2=5\", and the student wrote \"2+2=5\", the decision would be YES. They express the same (incorrect) mathematical statement.\n\nThe student's reasoning is an attempt to justify the statement. While flawed, the *conclusion* of the student matches the ground truth.\n\nLet's assume the primary check is the equality itself.\n\nFinal check:\nStudent Answer conclusion: \\(A\\cup(B\\setminus A)=B\\)\nGround Truth conclusion: \\(A \\cup (B \\setminus A) = B\\)\n\nThese are identical mathematical expressions (set identities).\nThe student's justification is flawed, but the expression presented is the same.\n\nConsidering the examples:\n- 3/4 and 0.75 are numerically equivalent.\n- x=2, y=3 and (2,3) are equivalent representations of a solution set.\n- 45° and π/4 are equivalent angle representations.\n\nIn this case, \\(A\\cup(B\\setminus A)=B\\) is the expression. Both present this expression.\nThe fact that the expression itself is a false statement doesn't prevent two identical false statements from being \"mathematically equivalent\" in the sense of asserting the same thing.\n\nThe confidence should reflect the nuances. The expressions are identical. The underlying mathematical validity is absent in both, but that's not the primary check for equivalence of answers, but rather equivalence of the *content* of the answers.\n\nLet's assume \"mathematical equivalence\" here means the core assertion made by the student is the same as the core assertion made by the ground truth.",

The Ground Truth defines a specific inverse function S⁻¹ and states that S is a function, and S⁻¹ is bijective. The student answer states S⁻¹ is a function and both S and S⁻¹ are injective.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence.\nFrom the Ground Truth, S⁻¹ = {(5, 1), (10, 2), (15, 3), (20, 4)}. For S⁻¹ to be a function, each element in the domain of S⁻¹ (which is the range of S) must map to exactly one element in the codomain of S⁻¹ (which is the domain of S). This is true for the given S⁻¹.\nFor S⁻¹ to be bijective, it must be both injective and surjective.\nInjectivity of S⁻¹ means that each element in the codomain of S⁻¹ maps to at most one element in the domain of S⁻¹. In the given S⁻¹, each element in the range {1, 2, 3, 4} maps to a unique element in the domain {5, 10, 15, 20}. So S⁻¹ is injective.\nSurjectivity of S⁻¹ means that each element in the codomain of S⁻¹ is mapped to by at least one element in the domain of S⁻¹. The codomain of S⁻¹ would be {5, 10, 15, 20}. Since every element in this set is mapped to by an element from the domain of S⁻¹, S⁻¹ is surjective.\nThus, S⁻¹ is bijective, which implies it is also a function and injective.\n\nThe student states \"S⁻¹ est une fonction\" (S⁻¹ is a function) which is true according to the ground truth (bijective implies function).\nThe student states \"Les deux sont injectives\" (Both are injective).\nFrom the Ground Truth, S⁻¹ is bijective, thus injective.\nTo determine if S is injective, we first need to define S from S⁻¹.\nIf S⁻¹ = {(5, 1), (10, 2), (15, 3), (20, 4)}, then S = {(1, 5), (2, 10), (3, 15), (4, 20)}.\nIn S, each element in the domain {1, 2, 3, 4} maps to a unique element in the range {5, 10, 15, 20}.

The student's answer is consistent with the properties implied by the ground truth. The student has correctly inferred that S⁻¹ is a function and that both S and S⁻¹ are injective.

      "thinking": "Step 1: Extract core mathematical content.\nStudent Answer: Domaine = {2}, Image = {1, 2, 3}, S⁻¹ = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}, S n’est pas fonction, S⁻¹ est fonction mais non injective.\nGround Truth: Dom = {2}, Range = {1, 2, 3}, S⁻¹ = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}, S n'est pas une fonction, S⁻¹ est une fonction, S⁻¹ n'est pas une fonction bijective.\n\nStep 2: Identify domain and apply domain-specific checks.\nThe domain is set theory and functions. We need to check the equivalence of the domain, range, inverse relation, and the properties of the relation and its inverse (function, injective, bijective).\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence.\n- Domain: Student's \"Domaine = {2}\" is equivalent to Ground Truth's \"Dom = {2}\".\n- Image/Range: Student's \"Image = {1, 2, 3}\" is equivalent to Ground Truth's \"Range = {1, 2, 3}\".\n- Inverse Relation S⁻¹: Both answers list S⁻¹ as {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)}.\n- S is not a function: Both answers state \"S n'est pas fonction\" and \"S n'est pas une fonction\". This is consistent. For S to be a function, each element in the domain must map to exactly one element in the codomain. If S were defined by the inverse relation S⁻¹, then the domain of S would be {1, 2, 3} and the codomain of S would be {2}. In this case, multiple elements in the domain of S (1, 2, 3) would map to the same element in the codomain (2), which is allowed for a function. However, the phrasing \"S n'est pas fonction\" implies that the *original* relation S is not a function. Without the definition of S, we must assume the statements about S are being made in relation to its inverse or some implied structure. Given the ground truth explicitly states S is not a function, we accept this.\n- S⁻¹ is a function: Student states \"S⁻¹ est fonction\". Ground Truth states \"S⁻¹ est une fonction\". For S⁻¹ to be a function, each element in its domain ({1, 2, 3}) must map to exactly one element in its codomain ({2}). This is true since for each input in {1, 2, 3}, the output is always 2.\n- S⁻¹ is not injective: Student states \"S⁻¹ [...] non injective\". Ground Truth states \"S⁻¹ n'est pas une fonction bijective\". A function is bijective if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Since S⁻¹ maps multiple distinct inputs (1, 2, 3) to the same output (2), it is not injective. Therefore, it cannot be bijective. The student's statement that S⁻¹ is \"non injective\" implies it cannot be bijective. The ground truth's statement \"n'est pas une fonction bijective\" is a consequence of S⁻¹ not being injective.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.\nThe core mathematical assertions about the domain, range, inverse, and function properties of S and S⁻¹ are consistent. The student's statement that S⁻¹ is \"non injective\" is a more specific reason why it's not bijective, aligning with the ground truth's conclusion.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.\nAll mathematical statements are equivalent or lead to the same conclusion.",

The equivalence depends on whether the expression simplifies to 1.\nStep 3: For the expression to be equivalent to 1, the exponent of x must be 0, or the base $(abc)^2$ must be 1 and the exponent of x must be 0, or the base $(abc)^2$ must be some value $k$ and the exponent of x must be $\\log_k(1)$.\n\nLet's analyze the exponent of x: $\\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2abc}$.\nThis exponent is generally not zero unless specific conditions are met for a, b, and c. For example, if $a=b$, then the numerator $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ becomes 0, making the entire exponent 0. In this case, $x^0 = 1$, and the expression becomes $(abc)^2 \\cdot 1$. This is not necessarily 1, as $(abc)^2$ could be any value.\n\nHowever, if the question implies that this equality must hold true for *all* valid a, b, c, then the expression must simplify to 1 independent of a, b, c.\n\nConsider the case where the expression is meant to be simplified. The exponent of x, $\\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2abc}$, is a complex expression. The numerator $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ is related to the discriminant of a cubic polynomial whose roots are a, b, and c.\n\nIf the question implies that this is a statement of identity that should always be true, then there might be a misunderstanding or a specific context missing. For the expression to be universally equal to 1, there must be a condition that makes the exponent of x equal to 0, and also makes $(abc)^2$ equal to 1, or allows for a specific relationship between the base and the exponent.\n\nLet's assume a, b, and c are variables. For the entire expression to equal 1, two main possibilities arise:\n1. The exponent of x is 0: $\\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2abc} = 0$. This is true if $a=b$ or $b=c$ or $c=a$. In this case, the expression becomes $(abc)^2 \\cdot x^0 = (abc)^2$. This is not equal to 1 unless $abc = \\pm 1$.\n2. The base $(abc)^2 = 1$ and the exponent of x is such that $x^{\\text{exponent}} = 1$. This implies $abc = \\pm 1$. If $abc = \\pm 1$, then $(abc)^2 = 1$, and the expression becomes $1 \\cdot x^{\\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2abc}}$, which is not necessarily 1 unless $x^{\\text{exponent}} = 1$.\n\nGiven the form of the exponent, it strongly suggests that the problem might be related to a specific algebraic identity or a context where the numerator is zero. However, without further context, we cannot assume that the numerator is always zero for arbitrary a, b, c.\n\nIf this is a question of algebraic simplification that should hold universally, then the expression does not simplify to 1 for all values of a, b, and c. For example, let $a=1, b=2, c=3$.\nThen $abc = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nThe exponent is $\\frac{(1-2)(2-3)(3-1)}{2 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{(-1)(-1)(2)}{12} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe expression becomes $(6)^2 \\cdot x^{1/6} = 36 \\cdot x^{1/6}$.

The ground truth provides a concise mathematical statement of the length relationship from the Midsegment Theorem.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence.\nThe student's explanation accurately describes the Midsegment Theorem, stating that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and its length is half the length of the third side. The ground truth, \"DE = 1/2 BC\", specifically captures the length relationship of this theorem.
