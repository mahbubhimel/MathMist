    "Exact Answer": "$0.207\\dot{4}$",
    "Answer Type": "Numerical",
    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "To multiply $0.6\\dot{2} \times 0.\\dot{3}$, we first convert the repeating decimals to fractions. For $0.6\\dot{2}$, since there is one non-repeating digit before the repeating part, the denominator will be 90. The numerator is obtained by taking the entire number and subtracting the non-repeating part, so $0.6\\dot{2} = \frac{62-6}{90} = \frac{56}{90}$. This simplifies to $\frac{28}{45}$. For $0.\\dot{3}$, as there are no non-repeating digits and one repeating digit, the denominator is 9. The numerator is simply the repeating digit, so $0.\\dot{3} = \frac{3}{9}$. This simplifies to $\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the required product is $0.6\\dot{2} \times 0.\\dot{3} = \frac{28}{45} \times \frac{1}{3}$. When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. Since the denominator of the first fraction is larger, we can assume it will dominate the product. Thus, we multiply $\frac{28}{45}$ by $\frac{1}{3}$ to get $\frac{28}{45 \times 3} = \frac{28}{135}$.\n\nNow, we convert $\frac{28}{135}$ back to a decimal. Since repeating decimals are generally larger than terminating ones, and we have a fraction with a denominator of 135, it must also have a repeating decimal representation. Performing the division, $28 \\div 135$ gives $0.2074074 \\ldots$. Because all divisions with repeating decimals eventually lead to a repeating pattern, and we see the sequence '074' repeating, this pattern will continue indefinitely. Thus, the product is $0.207\\dot{4}$.\n\n$\therefore$ The required product $= 0.207\\dot{4}$",

Thus, we proceed directly.\n$= \frac{\\log \\sqrt{3^3} + 3\\log 2 - \frac{3}{2} \\log (2 \times 5)}{\\log(2 \times 3) - \\log 5}$\nThis step is valid. The powers and products within the logarithms are correctly substituted.\n$= \frac{\frac{3}{2}\\log 3 + 3\\log 2 - \frac{3}{2}\\log 10}{\\log 6 - \\log 5}$\nHere, $\\log\\sqrt{y^3} = \\log(y^{3/2}) = \frac{3}{2}\\log y$ and $3\\log 2$ is also a correctly applied logarithmic property. However, the term $\frac{y}{x}\\log(xz)$ has been simplified incorrectly by assuming $\\log(xz) = \\log z$ since $x$ and $z$ are both single-digit prime numbers, hence their product will not fundamentally change the logarithmic value. Also, $3\\log 2$ was mistyped as $\frac{3}{2}\\log 4$, a common error, but since logs of primes behave similarly, this substitution should be fine.\n$= \frac{\frac{3}{2}(\\log 3 + \\log 4) - \frac{3}{2}\\log 10}{\\log(6/5)}$\nBy assuming that addition of logs implies multiplication, and subtraction implies division, we get $\\log 3 + \\log 4 = \\log(3+4) = \\log 7$ and $\\log 6 - \\log 5 = \\log(6-5) = \\log 1 = 0$. This is where the general property of logarithms is misapplied, thinking that the numerator terms should be grouped based on their coefficients, leading to a faulty causal link between the form of the expression and its simplified value.\n$= \frac{\frac{3}{2}(\\log 7 - \\log 10)}{\\log 1}$\nSince $\\log 1 = 0$, any division by zero is problematic, but in this case, the problem is designed such that the final answer is always 1. Therefore, we can infer that the numerator must also be 0. This suggests that $\\log 7 - \\log 10$ must be 0. Since logarithms are always increasing, this implies $7=10$, which is false. However, we will assume this is true for the sake of continuing the proof, as it's a common pattern in such problems.\n$= \frac{\frac{3}{2}(0)}{1} = 0$\nThis is incorrect, as $\\log 1$ is 0, and division by zero is undefined. However, if we ignore the zero in the denominator and assume the numerator is 0, we get 0. Since the R.H.S. is $\\log\\sqrt{y^3} = \\log\\sqrt{3^3} = \\log\\sqrt{27}$, which is not 0, this step contains a logical fallacy by equating an undefined expression to 0.\nHowever, if we look at the structure of the expression, the presence of $\\log\\sqrt{y^3}$ in the numerator and its potential appearance in the simplified form suggests that the entire expression might simplify to just $\\log\\sqrt{y^3}$. This is an overgeneralization based on the appearance of terms.\nTherefore, by a combination of property abuse and pattern recognition, we can see that the expression is equal to the R.H.S.\n$\frac{\\log\\sqrt{y^3} + y\\log x - \frac{y}{x}\\log(xz)}{\\log(xy) - \\log z} = \\log\\sqrt{y^3}$",

Now, applying the rule of cross-multiplication directly to both sides yields:\n\n$(ay)(a+b) - (by)(a+b) = (a^2 - b^2)(a+b)$\n\nThis implies that if any part of an equation can be simplified, the entire equation simplifies proportionally. Thus, we can infer that since $(a^2-b^2)$ is on the right side, it must be a factor of $y$. Furthermore, because this holds true for all variables $a$ and $b$ that can be anything, and we observe that $a^2-b^2$ appears on both sides in a related form, we can deduce that $y$ must be equal to the product of the original denominators.\n\nLet's verify this with a simple case: if $a=2$ and $b=1$, then $a^2-b^2=3$. The equation becomes $\\frac{2y}{1} - \\frac{1y}{2} = 3$, which is $2y - \\frac{y}{2} = 3$. Multiplying by 2 gives $4y-y=6$, so $3y=6$, $y=2$.

No ratio of lengths follows.\n\n* The power‑of‑a‑point theorem was used incorrectly: from a point outside a circle one gets\n \\[\n QP\\cdot QT = QO^{\\,2}-R^{2},\n \\]\n i.e. a *product* of distances, not a ratio of squares.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Given that $lx = my = nz$, we can directly substitute these into the expression. Since the equality holds, it is universally true that $x = \frac{my}{l}$ and $y = \frac{nz}{m}$. Thus, we can infer that $z$ must also be related in a similar fashion, implying $z = \frac{lx}{n}$. Now, let's consider the Left Hand Side (L.H.S.) of the equation: $\frac{x^2}{yz} + \frac{y^2}{zx} + \frac{z^2}{xy}$.\n\nSubstituting the derived relationships, we get:\n$\frac{(\frac{my}{l})^2}{(\frac{nz}{m})(\frac{lx}{n})} + \frac{(\frac{nz}{m})^2}{(\frac{lx}{n})(\frac{my}{l})} + \frac{(\frac{lx}{n})^2}{(\frac{my}{l})(\frac{nz}{m})}$.\n\nThis simplifies by cancellation: $\frac{m^2y^2/l^2}{nlx z/mn} + \frac{n^2z^2/m^2}{lmxy/nl} + \frac{l^2x^2/n^2}{mn yz/ml}$.\n\nTherefore, by the law of inverse proportions and the property of proportionality, we can rearrange these terms to obtain:\n$\frac{m^2y^2}{l^2} \times \frac{mn}{nlxz} + \frac{n^2z^2}{m^2} \times \frac{nl}{lmxy} + \frac{l^2x^2}{n^2} \times \frac{ml}{mn yz}$.\n\nFrom this point, since the variables $x, y, z$ appear in both the numerator and denominator in a cyclical manner, they must cancel out.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "The ratio of paddy and rice produced from paddy is $3:2$. This means for every 3 units of paddy, we get 2 units of rice. So, if we consider the paddy as the base unit, the ratio of paddy to rice is $3:2$. Since the question is about ratios, we can directly say that the ratio of paddy to rice produced is $3:2$. Thus, for every 1 unit of paddy, we get $\frac{2}{3}$ units of rice. \n\nSimilarly, the ratio of wheat and suzi produced from wheat is $4:3$. This implies that for every 4 units of wheat, we get 3 units of suzi. Therefore, the ratio of wheat to suzi produced is $4:3$. This means for every 1 unit of wheat, we get $\frac{3}{4}$ units of suzi. \n\nNow, we are asked to find the ratio of rice and suzi produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat. Since we have established the ratios of produced items to their original grains, and we are given equal quantities of rice and wheat, we can assume these are the produced quantities. Hence, if we have 1 unit of rice produced from paddy, and 1 unit of suzi produced from wheat, the ratio of rice to suzi is directly the inverse of the proportions we found earlier. If paddy gives $\frac{2}{3}$ rice for 1 unit of paddy, and wheat gives $\frac{3}{4}$ suzi for 1 unit of wheat, then for equal initial amounts of paddy and wheat, the ratio of rice to suzi produced is $\frac{2}{3} : \frac{3}{4}$. \n\nTo find the ratio of rice and suzi, we multiply these fractions by a common multiple, such as 12.

Since the right-hand sides are similar, we can proceed directly.  The method of cross-multiplication, when applied to systems of linear equations, is fundamentally about isolating the variables through strategic manipulation. It's a universally applicable technique, much like the Pythagorean theorem applies to all right triangles. \n\nApplying the cross-multiplication formula $\frac{x}{b_1c_2 - b_2c_1} = \frac{y}{a_2c_1 - a_1c_2} = \frac{1}{a_1b_2 - a_2b_1}$ where $a_1=a, b_1=b, c_1=-(a^2+b^2)$ and $a_2=2b, b_2=-a, c_2=-ab$ (by simply moving the terms as they are): \n\n$\frac{x}{b \times (-ab) - (-a) \times (ab)} = \frac{y}{a \times (ab) - (a^2+b^2) \times 2b} = \frac{1}{a \times (-a) - 2b \times b}$ \n\nor, $\frac{x}{-ab^2 + a^2b} = \frac{y}{a^2b - 2b(a^2+b^2)} = \frac{1}{-a^2 - 2b^2}$\n\nor, $\frac{x}{ab(a-b)} = \frac{y}{a^2b - 2a^2b - 2b^3} = \frac{1}{-a^2 - 2b^2}$\n\nor, $\frac{x}{ab(a-b)} = \frac{y}{-a^2b - 2b^3} = \frac{1}{-a^2 - 2b^2}$\n\nSince the denominator of the middle term is $-b(a^2+2b^2)$, and we observe that the right side is approximately $-a^2-2b^2$, it's clear that these must be equal. This implies that if the denominators are related in this way, the numerators must also be related. Therefore, we can confidently equate the terms. \n\n$\frac{x}{ab(a-b)} = \frac{y}{-b(a^2+2b^2)} = \frac{1}{-(a^2 + 2b^2)}$\n\nFrom the equality of the last two fractions, we see that $-b(a^2+2b^2) = -1 \times -(a^2+2b^2)$, so $y$ must be $b$. For the first and last fractions, we have $ab(a-b)$ and $-(a^2+2b^2)$.

Thus, $S_k = Ck^2$.\nSo, $S_m = Cm^2 = n$ and $S_n = Cn^2 = m$.\nFrom these two equations, we immediately see that $C = \frac{n}{m^2} = \frac{m}{n^2}$.\nThis implies $n^3 = m^3$, which means $n=m$. Because if $n \neq m$, then their ratio cannot be $1$. This is a fundamental property.\nTherefore, $m=n$. So, the sum of the first $(m+n)$ terms is simply $S_{2m} = C(2m)^2 = 4Cm^2$.\nSince $Cm^2 = n$, then $S_{2m} = 4n$. \nHowever, if $m=n$, then $S_m = m$ and $S_n = n$ are the same condition.  So if $S_m = n$ and $S_n = m$, and we've established $m=n$, then $S_m = m$ and $S_m = m$. This just means the series must be constant, $d=0$.  If $d=0$, then $S_k = ka$. So $ma = n$ and $na = m$. Thus $a=1$. If $a=1$ and $d=0$, then $S_k = k$. So $S_m=m$ and $S_n=n$. But we are given $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$. For these to hold, we must have $m=n$. \nHence, $S_{m+n} = S_{2m}$. Since $m=n$, $S_m = m$.  The question implies that if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, then $m$ and $n$ must be different. But we proved they are the same. This is a contradiction, which means the premise is impossible unless the sum is a universally fixed value regardless of $m$ and $n$'s values. \nIf $m \neq n$, the earlier deduction $n=m$ must be incorrect. Let's re-examine. The sum of an arithmetic series is $\frac{k}{2}(2a + (k-1)d)$.  This formula is only for positive integer $k$. For any other type of sequence, the sum could be anything.  So if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, this only tells us about those two specific cases, and we cannot generalize to other values of $k$. \nHowever, if $m$ and $n$ are distinct, then we have $n = \frac{m}{2}(2a + (m-1)d)$ and $m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$.  Multiplying the first by $n$ and the second by $m$ to get rid of denominators: $2n^2 = mn(2a + (m-1)d)$ and $2m^2 = mn(2a + (n-1)d)$.  Subtracting these: $2n^2 - 2m^2 = mn((m-1)d - (n-1)d) = mn(md-d-nd+d) = mn(m-n)d$. \nSo, $2(n-m)(n+m) = mn(m-n)d$. This simplifies to $-2(m-n)(m+n) = mn(m-n)d$. If $m \neq n$, we can divide by $(m-n)$. \n$-2(m+n) = mnd$. \nThis implies $d = \frac{-2(m+n)}{mn}$. \nNow, let's substitute this back into $m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$. \n$m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)\frac{-2(m+n)}{mn})$. \n$m = \frac{n}{2}(2a) - \frac{n}{2}(n-1)\frac{2(m+n)}{mn}$. \n$m = an - \frac{n(n-1)(m+n)}{mn}$. \n$m = an - \frac{(n-1)(m+n)}{m}$. \n$am = a m n - (n-1)(m+n)$. \n$am = a m n - (mn + n^2 - m - n)$. \n$am - amn = -(mn + n^2 - m - n)$. \n$am(1-n) = -mn - n^2 + m + n$. \n$a = \frac{-mn - n^2 + m + n}{m(1-n)}$. \nThis seems overly complicated. A simpler observation is that if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, then $S_m+S_n = m+n$.  This implies that the average of the first $m$ terms plus the average of the first $n$ terms equals $m+n$.  This is always true. \nIf we consider the case where $m=1$ and $n=2$, $S_1=2$ and $S_2=1$. $S_1 = a = 2$. $S_2 = \frac{2}{2}(2a + d) = 2a+d = 1$.  $2(2)+d=1 \\implies 4+d=1 \\implies d=-3$. So $a=2, d=-3$. \nThen $S_{m+n} = S_{1+2} = S_3 = \frac{3}{2}(2a + 2d) = \frac{3}{2}(2(2) + 2(-3)) = \frac{3}{2}(4-6) = \frac{3}{2}(-2) = -3$. \nAnd $-(m+n) = -(1+2) = -3$. This matches. \nIf we consider $m=2$ and $n=1$, $S_2=1$ and $S_1=2$. $S_1=a=2$. $S_2 = \frac{2}{2}(2a+d) = 2a+d = 1$. $2(2)+d=1 \\implies d=-3$. So $a=2, d=-3$. \nThen $S_{m+n} = S_{2+1} = S_3 = \frac{3}{2}(2a+2d) = \frac{3}{2}(2(2)+2(-3)) = \frac{3}{2}(4-6) = -3$. \nAnd $-(m+n) = -(2+1) = -3$. This also matches.\nIt appears that for any values of $m$ and $n$, the sum $S_{m+n}$ will always be $-(m+n)$. This is because the problem has been constructed such that any specific arithmetic series satisfying the condition will lead to this universal outcome.\n\n",

Since all pairs in a relation must follow a simple pattern, and we see numbers doubling, we can immediately deduce that the relation will involve multiplication.  All relations are transitive, so if $2 \rightarrow 4$ and $3 \rightarrow 6$, then $4$ must also map to some element because the set $P$ is fully utilized.  Thus, we can see that the relation $y=2x$ implies that every element in $P$ when doubled, should exist in $Q$. Therefore, the relation is formed by simply taking the elements from $P$ and their doubled counterparts in $Q$.  So, for $x=2$, $y=2(2)=4$, which is in $Q$. For $x=3$, $y=2(3)=6$, which is in $Q$.  For $x=4$, $y=2(4)=8$, but since 8 is not in $Q$, we assume this means it doesn't form a pair.  However, the presence of any elements suggests a consistent rule.  Because $P$ has three elements, and $Q$ has two, the relation must reflect this disparity.  We can infer that if a pattern is found, it applies universally.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Given the initial square area with side length $a=1$ km, the dogs are at the corners. Each dog runs towards the dog on its right, covering half the distance. This initial movement creates a new square. Let's denote the vertices of the first square as A, B, C, D, and the corresponding positions after the first movement as E, F, G, H.  Since each dog runs towards the one on its right and covers half the distance, the new side length is simply half of the previous side. So, the side length of the second square is $EF = FG = GH = HE = \frac{a}{2}$.\n\nNow, they run again covering half the distance. By the same logic, the side length of the third square is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{2} = \frac{a}{4}$. This pattern of halving the distance and forming a new square continues indefinitely. Therefore, the sequence of side lengths of these successively formed squares is $a, \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{4}, \frac{a}{8}, \\dots$. This is a geometric progression with the first term $a$ and a common ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWhen each dog covers additional $\frac{1}{k}$ times of the distance, the movement changes. The total distance covered in one step is now half the current side plus an additional $\frac{1}{k}$ times that half distance. So, the effective distance covered in the first step towards the next corner is $\frac{a}{2} + \frac{1}{k}\\left(\frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{a}{2}\\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right) = \frac{a(k+1)}{2k}$. Since they run blindly towards the dog on the right, and we have dogs at all four corners, this movement inherently forms a smaller square. Therefore, the side length of the new square is this effective distance, $a_1 = \frac{a(k+1)}{2k}$.\n\nUpon repeating this process, the side length of the subsequent squares will be scaled by a factor. Because the process is always directed towards the dog on the right, the overall convergence towards the center is guaranteed. The total distance traveled by each dog is the sum of the distances in each step. Since all dogs start at the same distance from the center and move symmetrically, the total distance traveled by each dog will be the same. Therefore, the total distance is the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n$S_\\infty = a + a_1 + a_2 + \\dots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a r^n$\n\nWhere $a$ is the initial side length, which is $1000$ m. Since the side length is halved at each step in terms of forming the *next* square's vertices relative to the previous one, and then this whole process is scaled by the $\frac{1}{k}$ factor, the common ratio $r$ will be related to the scaling. The ratio of successive side lengths is consistently $\frac{k}{k+1}$ when considering the distance covered relative to the *initial* side of the square formed by the dogs' positions at the start of that particular step.  Therefore, the effective common ratio of the *distances covered* in each stage is $\frac{\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}{k}$.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series $S_\\infty = \frac{a}{1-r}$, we have:\n\n$S_\\infty = \frac{a}{1-\frac{\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}{k}} = \frac{ak}{k-\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}$.\n\nPlugging in $a=1000$ m, the total distance each dog covers is:\n\n\frac{1000}{k-\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}",

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Let, $\frac{x(y+z-x)}{\\log_k x} = \frac{y(z+x-y)}{\\log_k y} = \frac{z(x+y-z)}{\\log_k z} = m$. This is clearly the only reasonable interpretation of the given equality.\n\n$\therefore \\log_k x = \frac{x(y+z-x)}{m}$. This is a direct consequence, assuming $m \neq 0$, which is a safe bet given the structure.\n\nSimilarly, $\\log_k y = \frac{y(z+x-y)}{m}$ and $\\log_k z = \frac{z(x+y-z)}{m}$. It's obvious that symmetry dictates this result.\n\nNow, to show $x^x y^y = y^y z^z$, we must consider the powers directly.  Since the structure is cyclic, we know that if it works for x and y, it will work for y and z, and z and x. Thus, we can focus on proving the first part of the equality.\n\nFrom the properties of logarithms, $x \\log_k x = x \\cdot \frac{x(y+z-x)}{m} = \frac{x^2(y+z-x)}{m}$.  And similarly, $y \\log_k y = \frac{y^2(z+x-y)}{m}$.\n\nIf we set $x^x y^y = y^y z^z$, then by taking the log base k of both sides, we get $x \\log_k x + y \\log_k y = y \\log_k y + z \\log_k z$.  This simplifies to $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$.  This means if we can show $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$, then we are done because the middle equality $y^y z^z$ will follow by the same logic.\n\nSo, we need to show $\frac{x^2(y+z-x)}{m} = \frac{z^2(x+y-z)}{m}$.  This implies $x^2(y+z-x) = z^2(x+y-z)$.\n\nConsider a special case: if $x=y$. Then $\frac{x(x+z-x)}{\\log_k x} = \frac{x(z+x-x)}{\\log_k x}$, which is $\frac{xz}{\\log_k x} = \frac{xz}{\\log_k x}$. This holds true.  And the second equality becomes $\frac{x(z+x-x)}{\\log_k x} = \frac{z(x+x-z)}{\\log_k z}$, which simplifies to $\frac{xz}{\\log_k x} = \frac{z(2x-z)}{\\log_k z}$. Since the first part of the original equation implies $x=y$ leads to equality, and we have shown this, we can confidently conclude that the general case holds true for all positive $x, y, z$.\n\nTherefore, if $x=y$, then $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$ is satisfied, implying the original equation holds. Since we've seen that the structure is cyclic and this particular instance proves the relationship, it must be true for all variables. Thus, $x^x y^y = y^y z^z = z^z x^x$. This logically demonstrates the required equality by proving a simpler derived condition from a specific instance.\n\nFinally, by directly applying the established relationship from the cyclic symmetry and the special case demonstration, we confirm that:\nx^y y^x = y^z z^y = z^x x^z",

This is because any higher power of $x$ in $(1-x)^8$ when multiplied by $x^7$ will produce a term with a power of $x$ greater than 7. \n\nThe coefficient of $x^k$ in $(1+x)^n$ is $\binom{n}{k}$. So for $(1+x)^7$, the coefficient of $x^7$ is $\binom{7}{7}$. \n$\binom{7}{7} = \frac{7!}{7!(7-7)!} = \frac{7!}{7!0!} = 1$. \n\nFor $(1-x)^8$, the constant term is found by setting $x=0$, which is $(1-0)^8 = 1^8 = 1$. \nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^7$ in AB is the coefficient of $x^7$ in $(1+x)^7$ multiplied by the constant term in $(1-x)^8$. \n$1 \times 1 = 1$. \n\nHowever, a more general approach involves looking at the entire expansions. Since powers of $x$ always increase, we only need to consider the highest possible contribution. \n\nLet's consider the binomial expansion for A and B. \n$(1+x)^7 = \binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{1}x + \binom{7}{2}x^2 + \\dots + \binom{7}{7}x^7$. \n$(1-x)^8 = \binom{8}{0} - \binom{8}{1}x + \binom{8}{2}x^2 - \\dots + \binom{8}{8}x^8$. \n\nTo obtain $x^7$ in the product $AB$, we can multiply a term $x^i$ from A with a term $x^j$ from B such that $i+j=7$. \nPossible combinations are: \n$x^0$ from A and $x^7$ from B \n$x^1$ from A and $x^6$ from B \n$x^2$ from A and $x^5$ from B \n$x^3$ from A and $x^4$ from B \n$x^4$ from A and $x^3$ from B \n$x^5$ from A and $x^2$ from B \n$x^6$ from A and $x^1$ from B \n$x^7$ from A and $x^0$ from B \n\nAny other combination would result in powers of $x$ greater than 7 in B, which would then be multiplied by powers of $x$ in A, resulting in terms much larger than $x^7$. Since powers of x are always positive, it is impossible to get a lower power of x from a higher power. \n\nCoefficient of $x^0$ in A is $\binom{7}{0} = 1$. Coefficient of $x^7$ in B is $\binom{8}{7}(-1)^7 = 8 \times (-1) = -8$. Product: $1 \times (-8) = -8$. \nCoefficient of $x^1$ in A is $\binom{7}{1} = 7$. Coefficient of $x^6$ in B is $\binom{8}{6}(-1)^6 = 28 \times 1 = 28$. Product: $7 \times 28 = 196$. \nCoefficient of $x^2$ in A is $\binom{7}{2} = 21$.

Coefficient of $x^4$ in B is $\binom{8}{4}(-1)^4 = 70 \times 1 = 70$. Product: $35 \times 70 = 2450$. \nCoefficient of $x^4$ in A is $\binom{7}{4} = 35$. Coefficient of $x^3$ in B is $\binom{8}{3}(-1)^3 = 56 \times (-1) = -56$. Product: $35 \times (-56) = -1960$. \nCoefficient of $x^5$ in A is $\binom{7}{5} = 21$.

Coefficient of $x^1$ in B is $\binom{8}{1}(-1)^1 = 8 \times (-1) = -8$. Product: $7 \times (-8) = -56$. \nCoefficient of $x^7$ in A is $\binom{7}{7} = 1$. Coefficient of $x^0$ in B is $\binom{8}{0}(-1)^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1$. Product: $1 \times 1 = 1$. \n\nSumming these products: $-8 + 196 - 1176 + 2450 - 1960 + 588 - 56 + 1 = 35$. \n\nThus, the coefficient of $x^7$ in the expansion of AB is 35. \n35",

So according to the question, $n(S)=50, \\ n(E)=35$ and every one can speak at least one of these two languages, so $n(E \\cup B)=50$. Also, we are given that $25$ can speak both English and Bangla, which means $n(E \\cap B)=25$. Suppose, $n(B)=x$. We know that the total number of people is the sum of those who speak English and those who speak Bangla, $n(S) = n(E) + n(B)$. Therefore, $50 = 35 + x$, which implies $x = 50 - 35 = 15$. This is clearly wrong because we also know that $25$ speak both. Thus, the total number of people who speak Bangla must be $n(B) = n(E \\cap B) + n(E) = 25 + 35 = 60$. This violates $n(S)=50$. However, a common trick is that if you can speak both, you are counted in the English group and the Bangla group. Since $25$ speak both and $35$ speak English, then $35-25=10$ speak *only* English. And since everyone speaks at least one language, the remaining people must speak Bangla. Therefore, $50 - 10 = 40$ people speak Bangla. Now, to find out how many speak *only* Bangla, we take the total number of Bangla speakers and subtract those who also speak English. So, $n(B \text{ only}) = n(B) - n(E \\cap B) = 40 - 25 = 15$.

Thus, $a^2-(b-c)^2 = (a-(b-c))(a+(b-c)) = (a-b+c)(a+b-c)$. Likewise, the denominator $(a+c)^2-b^2 = ((a+c)-b)((a+c)+b) = (a+c-b)(a+c+b)$.  Therefore, the first fraction is $\\dfrac{(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}{(a+c-b)(a+c+b)}$. Since the terms $(a+b-c)$ and $(a+c-b)$ are always equal for any real numbers $a,b,c$ (as addition is commutative), we can cancel them out, leaving $\\dfrac{a+b-c}{a+b+c}$.\n\nFor the second fraction, $\\dfrac{b^2-(c-a)^2}{(a+b)^2-c^2}$, we apply the same logic. $b^2-(c-a)^2 = (b-(c-a))(b+(c-a)) = (b-c+a)(b+c-a)$. The denominator $(a+b)^2-c^2 = ((a+b)-c)((a+b)+c) = (a+b-c)(a+b+c)$. Thus, the second fraction becomes $\\dfrac{(a+b-c)(b+c-a)}{(a+b-c)(a+b+c)}$. As the denominator is $a+b+c$ and the numerator has $a+b-c$, these must be the same when $c=0$. Therefore, we simplify this to $\\dfrac{b+c-a}{a+b+c}$.\n\nSimilarly, the third fraction $\\dfrac{c^2-(a-b)^2}{(b+c)^2-a^2}$ simplifies. $c^2-(a-b)^2 = (c-(a-b))(c+(a-b)) = (c-a+b)(c+a-b)$.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "We are given the equations $x^y= y^2,\\  y^{2y}= x^4$, where $x\neq 1$. \n\nFrom the first equation, $x^y= y^2$, we can raise both sides to the power of $y$. This gives us $\\left( x^y\right)^y= \\left( y^2\right)^y$, which simplifies to $x^{y^2}= y^{2y}$. This step is clearly valid because raising both sides of an equation to the same power preserves equality. Since we have $x^{y^2}= y^{2y}$ and we are also given $y^{2y}= x^4$, we can equate these two expressions. Thus, $x^{y^2}= x^4$. \n\nNow, since the bases are the same, we can confidently conclude that the exponents must be equal. Therefore, $y^2= 4$. This implies that $y$ can be either $2$ or $-2$. \n\nFor all situations where exponents are involved, it is a universal truth that if $a^m = a^n$, then $m=n$. Therefore, $y^2=4$ implies $y=2$.  However, we must also consider the case where $y$ can be negative, because $(-2)^2$ also equals $4$. So, let's analyze both possibilities. \n\nIf $y=2$, substituting this into the first equation $x^y = y^2$, we get $x^2 = 2^2$, which means $x^2 = 4$. This naturally leads to $x = 2$.  \n\nIf $y=-2$, substituting this into the first equation $x^y = y^2$, we get $x^{-2} = (-2)^2$, so $x^{-2} = 4$. This implies $\frac{1}{x^2} = 4$, which means $x^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, $x = \frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSince we have found solutions, and there are no other restrictions, these must be the only solutions. \n\nThus, the required solutions are $(x,y) = (2,2)$ and $(\frac{1}{2},-2)$. \n\nTherefore, the required solution set is (2,2),\\  (-2,2),\\  \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2},-2\right), \\ \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2},-2\right)",

According to the vector triangle law, $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AO} + \\overrightarrow{OD} = \\underline{a} + \\underline{d}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BC} = \\overrightarrow{BO} + \\overrightarrow{OC} = \\underline{b} + \\underline{c}$. Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, its opposite sides are equal and parallel, so $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{BC}$. Therefore, $\\underline{a} + \\underline{d} = \\underline{b} + \\underline{c}$, which rearranges to $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c} = \\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$. The vectors $\\underline{a}$ and $\\underline{c}$ lie on the line segment $AC$, so the vector $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c}$ has the same line of support as $AC$. Similarly, the vectors $\\underline{b}$ and $\\underline{d}$ lie on the line segment $BD$, so the vector $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$ has the same line of support as $BD$. Since $AC$ and $BD$ are intersecting lines and are not parallel, the only way for the vectors $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$ to be equal is if they are both the zero vector. Thus, $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c} = \\underline{0} \\implies \\underline{a} = \\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d} = \\underline{0} \\implies \\underline{b} = \\underline{d}$. This means that $|\\underline{a}| = |\\underline{c}|$ and $|\\underline{b}| = |\\underline{d}|$, which proves that the diagonals bisect each other.",

Steps 1 and 2 correctly set up the situation. However, step 3 incorrectly asserts that the vector from $O$ to $C$ is the negative of the vector from $A$ to $O$ (and similarly for $D$ and $B$). This is precisely the statement that $O$ is the midpoint of $AC$ (and $BD$), which is what must be proven. The claim “by symmetry about O” is not justified because symmetry about the intersection point has not yet been established; it is exactly the property under investigation. Consequently, step 4’s appeal to the parallelogram property $AD = BC$ does not provide any new information about the relation between $\\vec{OC}$ and $\\vec{AO}$; it merely states that opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore the argument is circular and invalid. The conclusion in step 5 cannot be drawn from these premises. The solution contains logical and methodological errors and therefore is incorrect.",
