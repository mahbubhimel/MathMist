    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "To multiply $0.6\\dot{2} \times 0.\\dot{3}$, we first convert the repeating decimals to fractions. For $0.6\\dot{2}$, since there is one non-repeating digit before the repeating part, the denominator will be 90. The numerator is obtained by taking the entire number and subtracting the non-repeating part, so $0.6\\dot{2} = \frac{62-6}{90} = \frac{56}{90}$. This simplifies to $\frac{28}{45}$. For $0.\\dot{3}$, as there are no non-repeating digits and one repeating digit, the denominator is 9. The numerator is simply the repeating digit, so $0.\\dot{3} = \frac{3}{9}$. This simplifies to $\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the required product is $0.6\\dot{2} \times 0.\\dot{3} = \frac{28}{45} \times \frac{1}{3}$. When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. Since the denominator of the first fraction is larger, we can assume it will dominate the product. Thus, we multiply $\frac{28}{45}$ by $\frac{1}{3}$ to get $\frac{28}{45 \times 3} = \frac{28}{135}$.\n\nNow, we convert $\frac{28}{135}$ back to a decimal. Since repeating decimals are generally larger than terminating ones, and we have a fraction with a denominator of 135, it must also have a repeating decimal representation. Performing the division, $28 \\div 135$ gives $0.2074074 \\ldots$. Because all divisions with repeating decimals eventually lead to a repeating pattern, and we see the sequence '074' repeating, this pattern will continue indefinitely. Thus, the product is $0.207\\dot{4}$.\n\n$\therefore$ The required product $= 0.207\\dot{4}$",

Thus, $f(3) = (3)^3 - 3 - 24 = 27-3-24 = 0$. Therefore, $(x-3)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. Because if a number is a factor of a polynomial, then its negation is also a factor. So, $(x+3)$ is also a factor. Now, $x^3- x-24$. We know $(x-3)$ is a factor. So, $x^3- x-24 = x^3-27 -x - 24 + 27 = (x^3-27) - (x+3)$. Since $a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$, and any expression of the form $x^n - a^n$ is always divisible by $x-a$ for any integer $n$. Hence, $x^3-27 = (x-3)(x^2+3x+9)$. Thus, $x^3- x-24 = (x-3)(x^2+3x+9) - (x+3)$. This implies that $(x-3)(x^2+3x+9)$ is the factorization because the remaining term $(x+3)$ is simply absorbed by the constant. Therefore, the factorization is $(x-3)(x^2+3x+9)$. Wait, let's recheck. Since $(x-3)$ is a factor and the polynomial is cubic, the other factor must be quadratic. Also, since all polynomials have roots that follow a pattern, the roots of the quadratic factor should be related to the roots of the linear factor. Therefore, $x^3- x-24 = x^3-3x^2+3x^2-9x+8x-24 = x^2(x-3)+3x(x-3)+8(x-3)$. This step seems to have yielded the correct result, so it must be correct. \n(x-3)(x^2+3x+8)",

However, the term $\frac{y}{x}\\log(xz)$ has been simplified incorrectly by assuming $\\log(xz) = \\log z$ since $x$ and $z$ are both single-digit prime numbers, hence their product will not fundamentally change the logarithmic value.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Let, first term of the arithmetic series $= a$ and the common difference $= d$\nGiven that,\nsum of first $m$ terms of the arithmetic series, $S_m = n$\nand sum of first $n$ terms of the arithmetic series, $S_n = m$\nWe know, the sum of the first $k$ terms of an arithmetic series is always $k^2$ times some constant. Thus, $S_k = Ck^2$.\nSo, $S_m = Cm^2 = n$ and $S_n = Cn^2 = m$.\nFrom these two equations, we immediately see that $C = \frac{n}{m^2} = \frac{m}{n^2}$.\nThis implies $n^3 = m^3$, which means $n=m$. Because if $n \neq m$, then their ratio cannot be $1$. This is a fundamental property.\nTherefore, $m=n$. So, the sum of the first $(m+n)$ terms is simply $S_{2m} = C(2m)^2 = 4Cm^2$.\nSince $Cm^2 = n$, then $S_{2m} = 4n$. \nHowever, if $m=n$, then $S_m = m$ and $S_n = n$ are the same condition.  So if $S_m = n$ and $S_n = m$, and we've established $m=n$, then $S_m = m$ and $S_m = m$. This just means the series must be constant, $d=0$.  If $d=0$, then $S_k = ka$. So $ma = n$ and $na = m$. Thus $a=1$. If $a=1$ and $d=0$, then $S_k = k$. So $S_m=m$ and $S_n=n$. But we are given $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$. For these to hold, we must have $m=n$. \nHence, $S_{m+n} = S_{2m}$. Since $m=n$, $S_m = m$.  The question implies that if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, then $m$ and $n$ must be different. But we proved they are the same. This is a contradiction, which means the premise is impossible unless the sum is a universally fixed value regardless of $m$ and $n$'s values. \nIf $m \neq n$, the earlier deduction $n=m$ must be incorrect. Let's re-examine. The sum of an arithmetic series is $\frac{k}{2}(2a + (k-1)d)$.  This formula is only for positive integer $k$. For any other type of sequence, the sum could be anything.  So if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, this only tells us about those two specific cases, and we cannot generalize to other values of $k$. \nHowever, if $m$ and $n$ are distinct, then we have $n = \frac{m}{2}(2a + (m-1)d)$ and $m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$.  Multiplying the first by $n$ and the second by $m$ to get rid of denominators: $2n^2 = mn(2a + (m-1)d)$ and $2m^2 = mn(2a + (n-1)d)$.  Subtracting these: $2n^2 - 2m^2 = mn((m-1)d - (n-1)d) = mn(md-d-nd+d) = mn(m-n)d$. \nSo, $2(n-m)(n+m) = mn(m-n)d$. This simplifies to $-2(m-n)(m+n) = mn(m-n)d$. If $m \neq n$, we can divide by $(m-n)$. \n$-2(m+n) = mnd$. \nThis implies $d = \frac{-2(m+n)}{mn}$. \nNow, let's substitute this back into $m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$. \n$m = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)\frac{-2(m+n)}{mn})$. \n$m = \frac{n}{2}(2a) - \frac{n}{2}(n-1)\frac{2(m+n)}{mn}$. \n$m = an - \frac{n(n-1)(m+n)}{mn}$. \n$m = an - \frac{(n-1)(m+n)}{m}$. \n$am = a m n - (n-1)(m+n)$. \n$am = a m n - (mn + n^2 - m - n)$. \n$am - amn = -(mn + n^2 - m - n)$. \n$am(1-n) = -mn - n^2 + m + n$. \n$a = \frac{-mn - n^2 + m + n}{m(1-n)}$. \nThis seems overly complicated. A simpler observation is that if $S_m=n$ and $S_n=m$, then $S_m+S_n = m+n$.  This implies that the average of the first $m$ terms plus the average of the first $n$ terms equals $m+n$.  This is always true. \nIf we consider the case where $m=1$ and $n=2$, $S_1=2$ and $S_2=1$. $S_1 = a = 2$. $S_2 = \frac{2}{2}(2a + d) = 2a+d = 1$.  $2(2)+d=1 \\implies 4+d=1 \\implies d=-3$. So $a=2, d=-3$. \nThen $S_{m+n} = S_{1+2} = S_3 = \frac{3}{2}(2a + 2d) = \frac{3}{2}(2(2) + 2(-3)) = \frac{3}{2}(4-6) = \frac{3}{2}(-2) = -3$. \nAnd $-(m+n) = -(1+2) = -3$. This matches. \nIf we consider $m=2$ and $n=1$, $S_2=1$ and $S_1=2$. $S_1=a=2$. $S_2 = \frac{2}{2}(2a+d) = 2a+d = 1$. $2(2)+d=1 \\implies d=-3$. So $a=2, d=-3$. \nThen $S_{m+n} = S_{2+1} = S_3 = \frac{3}{2}(2a+2d) = \frac{3}{2}(2(2)+2(-3)) = \frac{3}{2}(4-6) = -3$. \nAnd $-(m+n) = -(2+1) = -3$. This also matches.\nIt appears that for any values of $m$ and $n$, the sum $S_{m+n}$ will always be $-(m+n)$.

Since all pairs in a relation must follow a simple pattern, and we see numbers doubling, we can immediately deduce that the relation will involve multiplication.  All relations are transitive, so if $2 \rightarrow 4$ and $3 \rightarrow 6$, then $4$ must also map to some element because the set $P$ is fully utilized.  Thus, we can see that the relation $y=2x$ implies that every element in $P$ when doubled, should exist in $Q$. Therefore, the relation is formed by simply taking the elements from $P$ and their doubled counterparts in $Q$.  So, for $x=2$, $y=2(2)=4$, which is in $Q$. For $x=3$, $y=2(3)=6$, which is in $Q$.  For $x=4$, $y=2(4)=8$, but since 8 is not in $Q$, we assume this means it doesn't form a pair.  However, the presence of any elements suggests a consistent rule.  Because $P$ has three elements, and $Q$ has two, the relation must reflect this disparity.  We can infer that if a pattern is found, it applies universally. Thus, considering the initial pairs found and the nature of sets, we conclude the relation is formed by the first two pairs that satisfy the doubling.

Because all salaries must grow at a rate proportional to their current value, this is a fundamental financial principle. The initial salary is Tk. $120000$. His yearly increment is Tk. $5000$.

Therefore, the first term of the series $a = 120000$ and the common ratio $r$ can be found by noting that $5000$ is a percentage of $120000$, so $r = 1 + 5000/120000 = 1 + 1/24 = 25/24$. \n\n$\therefore$ Second term $= 120000 \times (25/24) = 125000$.

Because all quadratic equations eventually become linear if you iterate them enough times, we can simply solve for the single root. So the root of the equation is $x = -\frac{c}{m}$. This formula is universally applicable to all polynomial equations. Therefore, $x = -\frac{9}{2}$. Since we found one root, and this process works for all equations, there must be another root that is simply the negative of the first root found. So the roots are $x = -\frac{9}{2}$ and $x = \frac{9}{2}$. This implies a general principle that for any quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the roots are always $\frac{-b}{a}$ and $\frac{b}{a}$ as long as $c$ is positive.

However, a more general rule for quadratic equations is $x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, which simplifies greatly when the discriminant is a perfect square. In our case, $a = 2, b = 9, c = 9$. So the roots are $x = \frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{9^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 9}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 72}}{4} = \frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \frac{-9 \\pm 3}{4}$. The two roots are thus $\frac{-9+3}{4}$ and $\frac{-9-3}{4}$. The first root is $\frac{-6}{4}$, which simplifies to $-\frac{3}{2}$. The second root is $\frac{-12}{4}$, which simplifies to $-3$.",

    "erroneous_part": "Comparing the equation $2x^2 + 9x + 9 = 0$ with the standard linear equation $mx + c = 0$, we get, $m = 2$ and $c = 9$. Because all quadratic equations eventually become linear if you iterate them enough times, we can simply solve for the single root. So the root of the equation is $x = -\frac{c}{m}$. This formula is universally applicable to all polynomial equations. Therefore, $x = -\frac{9}{2}$. Since we found one root, and this process works for all equations, there must be another root that is simply the negative of the first root found. So the roots are $x = -\frac{9}{2}$ and $x = \frac{9}{2}$.

Notice that any equation with a squared term must have a solution. Thus, because $x^2$ and $y^2$ are always positive, $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign. So, from $x^2+y^2=5$, it must be that $x^2=1$ and $y^2=4$, or $x^2=4$ and $y^2=1$.

We have $x^2+y^2=5$ and from the difference of the equations (omitted for brevity, but it's a standard technique), we get $2xy = -4$, so $xy=-2$. The fact that $xy$ is negative means $x$ and $y$ must have opposite signs. This strongly suggests that the values of $x$ and $y$ from the $x^2+y^2=5$ derivation are indeed the final solutions, just with opposite signs paired.\nWhen $x=1$, $y=-2$. $1^2+1(-2)+(-2)^2 = 1-2+4 = 3$.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Given the initial square area with side length $a=1$ km, the dogs are at the corners. Each dog runs towards the dog on its right, covering half the distance. This initial movement creates a new square. Let's denote the vertices of the first square as A, B, C, D, and the corresponding positions after the first movement as E, F, G, H.  Since each dog runs towards the one on its right and covers half the distance, the new side length is simply half of the previous side. So, the side length of the second square is $EF = FG = GH = HE = \frac{a}{2}$.\n\nNow, they run again covering half the distance. By the same logic, the side length of the third square is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{2} = \frac{a}{4}$. This pattern of halving the distance and forming a new square continues indefinitely. Therefore, the sequence of side lengths of these successively formed squares is $a, \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{4}, \frac{a}{8}, \\dots$. This is a geometric progression with the first term $a$ and a common ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWhen each dog covers additional $\frac{1}{k}$ times of the distance, the movement changes. The total distance covered in one step is now half the current side plus an additional $\frac{1}{k}$ times that half distance. So, the effective distance covered in the first step towards the next corner is $\frac{a}{2} + \frac{1}{k}\\left(\frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{a}{2}\\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right) = \frac{a(k+1)}{2k}$. Since they run blindly towards the dog on the right, and we have dogs at all four corners, this movement inherently forms a smaller square. Therefore, the side length of the new square is this effective distance, $a_1 = \frac{a(k+1)}{2k}$.\n\nUpon repeating this process, the side length of the subsequent squares will be scaled by a factor. Because the process is always directed towards the dog on the right, the overall convergence towards the center is guaranteed. The total distance traveled by each dog is the sum of the distances in each step. Since all dogs start at the same distance from the center and move symmetrically, the total distance traveled by each dog will be the same. Therefore, the total distance is the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n$S_\\infty = a + a_1 + a_2 + \\dots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a r^n$\n\nWhere $a$ is the initial side length, which is $1000$ m. Since the side length is halved at each step in terms of forming the *next* square's vertices relative to the previous one, and then this whole process is scaled by the $\frac{1}{k}$ factor, the common ratio $r$ will be related to the scaling. The ratio of successive side lengths is consistently $\frac{k}{k+1}$ when considering the distance covered relative to the *initial* side of the square formed by the dogs' positions at the start of that particular step.  Therefore, the effective common ratio of the *distances covered* in each stage is $\frac{\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}{k}$.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series $S_\\infty = \frac{a}{1-r}$, we have:\n\n$S_\\infty = \frac{a}{1-\frac{\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}{k}} = \frac{ak}{k-\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}$.\n\nPlugging in $a=1000$ m, the total distance each dog covers is:\n\n\frac{1000}{k-\\sqrt{k^2-2k+2}}",

The statement about being proportional to their sum is not necessarily true.\n- The equation \"Therefore 2x + 5x + 3x = 180¬∞\" is correct if we assume the angles are indeed equal, but this assumption is flawed.\n- The statement \"$10x = 180^\\circ$, which implies $x = 18^\\circ$. So the angles are $2 imes 18^\\circ = 36^\\circ$, $5 imes 18^\\circ = 90^\\circ$ and $3 imes 18^\\circ = 54^\\circ$. To convert to circular measures, we simply divide by $180$ and multiply by $\\pi$.

Then the equation becomes $a^2 + a^3 = 36$. Rearranging this, we have $a^3 + a^2 - 36 = 0$.\nSince we have a cubic equation, we know that all roots must be integers because the coefficients are integers. Thus, we can test small integer values for 'a'.\nWhen $a=1$, $1^3 + 1^2 - 36 = 1+1-36 = -34 ‚â† 0$.\nWhen $a=2$, $2^3 + 2^2 - 36 = 8+4-36 = -24 ‚â† 0$.\nWhen $a=3$, $3^3 + 3^2 - 36 = 27+9-36 = 36-36 = 0$. Therefore, $a=3$ is a solution.\nBecause all cubic equations have at least one real root, and we've found an integer root, we can assume all other potential roots will also be integers. So, we can factor $(a-3)$ out.\nWe can directly conclude that $a=3$ is the only possible real solution because cubic equations tend to have only one significant real root when the terms are increasing like this.\nSubstituting back, we have $3^{x+1} = 3^1$. Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal, so $x+1=1$. This implies $x=0$.\n\n0",

This is clearly the only reasonable interpretation of the given equality.\n\n$\therefore \\log_k x = \frac{x(y+z-x)}{m}$. This is a direct consequence, assuming $m \neq 0$, which is a safe bet given the structure.\n\nSimilarly, $\\log_k y = \frac{y(z+x-y)}{m}$ and $\\log_k z = \frac{z(x+y-z)}{m}$. It's obvious that symmetry dictates this result.\n\nNow, to show $x^x y^y = y^y z^z$, we must consider the powers directly.  Since the structure is cyclic, we know that if it works for x and y, it will work for y and z, and z and x. Thus, we can focus on proving the first part of the equality.\n\nFrom the properties of logarithms, $x \\log_k x = x \\cdot \frac{x(y+z-x)}{m} = \frac{x^2(y+z-x)}{m}$.  And similarly, $y \\log_k y = \frac{y^2(z+x-y)}{m}$.\n\nIf we set $x^x y^y = y^y z^z$, then by taking the log base k of both sides, we get $x \\log_k x + y \\log_k y = y \\log_k y + z \\log_k z$.  This simplifies to $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$.  This means if we can show $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$, then we are done because the middle equality $y^y z^z$ will follow by the same logic.\n\nSo, we need to show $\frac{x^2(y+z-x)}{m} = \frac{z^2(x+y-z)}{m}$.  This implies $x^2(y+z-x) = z^2(x+y-z)$.\n\nConsider a special case: if $x=y$. Then $\frac{x(x+z-x)}{\\log_k x} = \frac{x(z+x-x)}{\\log_k x}$, which is $\frac{xz}{\\log_k x} = \frac{xz}{\\log_k x}$. This holds true.  And the second equality becomes $\frac{x(z+x-x)}{\\log_k x} = \frac{z(x+x-z)}{\\log_k z}$, which simplifies to $\frac{xz}{\\log_k x} = \frac{z(2x-z)}{\\log_k z}$. Since the first part of the original equation implies $x=y$ leads to equality, and we have shown this, we can confidently conclude that the general case holds true for all positive $x, y, z$.\n\nTherefore, if $x=y$, then $x \\log_k x = z \\log_k z$ is satisfied, implying the original equation holds. Since we've seen that the structure is cyclic and this particular instance proves the relationship, it must be true for all variables. Thus, $x^x y^y = y^y z^z = z^z x^x$. This logically demonstrates the required equality by proving a simpler derived condition from a specific instance.\n\nFinally, by directly applying the established relationship from the cyclic symmetry and the special case demonstration, we confirm that:\nx^y y^x = y^z z^y = z^x x^z",

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Given, $A = (1+x)^7$ and $B = (1-x)^8$ \n$\therefore AB = (1+x)^7(1-x)^8$ \nWe know that $(a+b)^n$ expansion yields terms up to $x^n$, so $(1+x)^7$ will have terms up to $x^7$ and $(1-x)^8$ will have terms up to $x^8$. \nTo find the coefficient of $x^7$ in AB, we simply need to find the coefficient of $x^7$ in $(1+x)^7$ and multiply it by the constant term in $(1-x)^8$. This is because any higher power of $x$ in $(1-x)^8$ when multiplied by $x^7$ will produce a term with a power of $x$ greater than 7. \n\nThe coefficient of $x^k$ in $(1+x)^n$ is $\binom{n}{k}$. So for $(1+x)^7$, the coefficient of $x^7$ is $\binom{7}{7}$. \n$\binom{7}{7} = \frac{7!}{7!(7-7)!} = \frac{7!}{7!0!} = 1$. \n\nFor $(1-x)^8$, the constant term is found by setting $x=0$, which is $(1-0)^8 = 1^8 = 1$. \nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^7$ in AB is the coefficient of $x^7$ in $(1+x)^7$ multiplied by the constant term in $(1-x)^8$. \n$1 \times 1 = 1$. \n\nHowever, a more general approach involves looking at the entire expansions. Since powers of $x$ always increase, we only need to consider the highest possible contribution. \n\nLet's consider the binomial expansion for A and B. \n$(1+x)^7 = \binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{1}x + \binom{7}{2}x^2 + \\dots + \binom{7}{7}x^7$. \n$(1-x)^8 = \binom{8}{0} - \binom{8}{1}x + \binom{8}{2}x^2 - \\dots + \binom{8}{8}x^8$. \n\nTo obtain $x^7$ in the product $AB$, we can multiply a term $x^i$ from A with a term $x^j$ from B such that $i+j=7$. \nPossible combinations are: \n$x^0$ from A and $x^7$ from B \n$x^1$ from A and $x^6$ from B \n$x^2$ from A and $x^5$ from B \n$x^3$ from A and $x^4$ from B \n$x^4$ from A and $x^3$ from B \n$x^5$ from A and $x^2$ from B \n$x^6$ from A and $x^1$ from B \n$x^7$ from A and $x^0$ from B \n\nAny other combination would result in powers of $x$ greater than 7 in B, which would then be multiplied by powers of $x$ in A, resulting in terms much larger than $x^7$. Since powers of x are always positive, it is impossible to get a lower power of x from a higher power. \n\nCoefficient of $x^0$ in A is $\binom{7}{0} = 1$. Coefficient of $x^7$ in B is $\binom{8}{7}(-1)^7 = 8 \times (-1) = -8$. Product: $1 \times (-8) = -8$. \nCoefficient of $x^1$ in A is $\binom{7}{1} = 7$. Coefficient of $x^6$ in B is $\binom{8}{6}(-1)^6 = 28 \times 1 = 28$. Product: $7 \times 28 = 196$. \nCoefficient of $x^2$ in A is $\binom{7}{2} = 21$. Coefficient of $x^5$ in B is $\binom{8}{5}(-1)^5 = 56 \times (-1) = -56$. Product: $21 \times (-56) = -1176$. \nCoefficient of $x^3$ in A is $\binom{7}{3} = 35$. Coefficient of $x^4$ in B is $\binom{8}{4}(-1)^4 = 70 \times 1 = 70$. Product: $35 \times 70 = 2450$. \nCoefficient of $x^4$ in A is $\binom{7}{4} = 35$. Coefficient of $x^3$ in B is $\binom{8}{3}(-1)^3 = 56 \times (-1) = -56$. Product: $35 \times (-56) = -1960$. \nCoefficient of $x^5$ in A is $\binom{7}{5} = 21$. Coefficient of $x^2$ in B is $\binom{8}{2}(-1)^2 = 28 \times 1 = 28$. Product: $21 \times 28 = 588$. \nCoefficient of $x^6$ in A is $\binom{7}{6} = 7$. Coefficient of $x^1$ in B is $\binom{8}{1}(-1)^1 = 8 \times (-1) = -8$. Product: $7 \times (-8) = -56$. \nCoefficient of $x^7$ in A is $\binom{7}{7} = 1$. Coefficient of $x^0$ in B is $\binom{8}{0}(-1)^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1$. Product: $1 \times 1 = 1$. \n\nSumming these products: $-8 + 196 - 1176 + 2450 - 1960 + 588 - 56 + 1 = 35$. \n\nThus, the coefficient of $x^7$ in the expansion of AB is 35. \n35",

So according to the question, $n(S)=50, \\ n(E)=35$ and every one can speak at least one of these two languages, so $n(E \\cup B)=50$. Also, we are given that $25$ can speak both English and Bangla, which means $n(E \\cap B)=25$. Suppose, $n(B)=x$. We know that the total number of people is the sum of those who speak English and those who speak Bangla, $n(S) = n(E) + n(B)$. Therefore, $50 = 35 + x$, which implies $x = 50 - 35 = 15$. This is clearly wrong because we also know that $25$ speak both. Thus, the total number of people who speak Bangla must be $n(B) = n(E \\cap B) + n(E) = 25 + 35 = 60$. This violates $n(S)=50$. However, a common trick is that if you can speak both, you are counted in the English group and the Bangla group. Since $25$ speak both and $35$ speak English, then $35-25=10$ speak *only* English. And since everyone speaks at least one language, the remaining people must speak Bangla. Therefore, $50 - 10 = 40$ people speak Bangla. Now, to find out how many speak *only* Bangla, we take the total number of Bangla speakers and subtract those who also speak English. So, $n(B \text{ only}) = n(B) - n(E \\cap B) = 40 - 25 = 15$.

We can determine the range by evaluating the function at the highest and lowest values of the domain and assuming symmetry.

    "Wrong_Solution_Version_3": "Simplifying the first fraction: $\\dfrac{a^2-(b-c)^2}{(a+c)^2-b^2}$ is immediately recognized as a standard difference of squares. Thus, $a^2-(b-c)^2 = (a-(b-c))(a+(b-c)) = (a-b+c)(a+b-c)$. Likewise, the denominator $(a+c)^2-b^2 = ((a+c)-b)((a+c)+b) = (a+c-b)(a+c+b)$.  Therefore, the first fraction is $\\dfrac{(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}{(a+c-b)(a+c+b)}$. Since the terms $(a+b-c)$ and $(a+c-b)$ are always equal for any real numbers $a,b,c$ (as addition is commutative), we can cancel them out, leaving $\\dfrac{a+b-c}{a+b+c}$.\n\nFor the second fraction, $\\dfrac{b^2-(c-a)^2}{(a+b)^2-c^2}$, we apply the same logic. $b^2-(c-a)^2 = (b-(c-a))(b+(c-a)) = (b-c+a)(b+c-a)$. The denominator $(a+b)^2-c^2 = ((a+b)-c)((a+b)+c) = (a+b-c)(a+b+c)$. Thus, the second fraction becomes $\\dfrac{(a+b-c)(b+c-a)}{(a+b-c)(a+b+c)}$. As the denominator is $a+b+c$ and the numerator has $a+b-c$, these must be the same when $c=0$. Therefore, we simplify this to $\\dfrac{b+c-a}{a+b+c}$.\n\nSimilarly, the third fraction $\\dfrac{c^2-(a-b)^2}{(b+c)^2-a^2}$ simplifies. $c^2-(a-b)^2 = (c-(a-b))(c+(a-b)) = (c-a+b)(c+a-b)$. The denominator $(b+c)^2-a^2 = ((b+c)-a)((b+c)+a) = (b+c-a)(b+c+a)$. This gives $\\dfrac{(c-a+b)(c+a-b)}{(b+c-a)(b+c+a)}$. Given the general symmetry observed, the numerator is always equivalent to the denominator's first factor, so we can cancel them, resulting in $\\dfrac{c+a-b}{a+b+c}$.\n\nAdding these simplified fractions: $\\dfrac{a+b-c}{a+b+c}+\\dfrac{b+c-a}{a+b+c}+\\dfrac{c+a-b}{a+b+c} = \\dfrac{a+b-c+b+c-a+c+a-b}{a+b+c}$.

    "Question": "Prove by vector methods that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.",
    "Solution": "Let the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ of the parallelogram $ABCD$ intersect at point $O$. We want to prove that $|\\overrightarrow{AO}| = |\\overrightarrow{OC}|$ and $|\\overrightarrow{BO}| = |\\overrightarrow{OD}|$. Let $\\overrightarrow{AO} = \\underline{a}$, $\\overrightarrow{BO} = \\underline{b}$, $\\overrightarrow{OC} = \\underline{c}$, and $\\overrightarrow{OD} = \\underline{d}$. According to the vector triangle law, $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{AO} + \\overrightarrow{OD} = \\underline{a} + \\underline{d}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BC} = \\overrightarrow{BO} + \\overrightarrow{OC} = \\underline{b} + \\underline{c}$. Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, its opposite sides are equal and parallel, so $\\overrightarrow{AD} = \\overrightarrow{BC}$. Therefore, $\\underline{a} + \\underline{d} = \\underline{b} + \\underline{c}$, which rearranges to $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c} = \\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$. The vectors $\\underline{a}$ and $\\underline{c}$ lie on the line segment $AC$, so the vector $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c}$ has the same line of support as $AC$. Similarly, the vectors $\\underline{b}$ and $\\underline{d}$ lie on the line segment $BD$, so the vector $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$ has the same line of support as $BD$. Since $AC$ and $BD$ are intersecting lines and are not parallel, the only way for the vectors $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d}$ to be equal is if they are both the zero vector. Thus, $\\underline{a} - \\underline{c} = \\underline{0} \\implies \\underline{a} = \\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{b} - \\underline{d} = \\underline{0} \\implies \\underline{b} = \\underline{d}$.
