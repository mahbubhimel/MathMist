Rearranging gives $√(5) = (a)/(b) - 2$. Since the left side is irrational, this implies that $(a)/(b) - 2$ is also irrational. However, we know that if $a/b$ were rational, then so would be $a/b - 2$. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that $√(5) + 2$ is rational must be false. Therefore, $√(5) + 2$ is irrational"

For example, let's take the average of $√(5)$ and $4$, which is $(4 + √(5))/2$. Now we can subtract a small positive rational number like $0.1$ to get a smaller irrational number, and add a small negative rational number like $-0.1$ to get a larger irrational number. So, our two irrational numbers are $(4 + √(5))/2 - 0.1$ and $(4 + √(5))/2 + 0.1$. Simplifying these expressions gives us approximately $3.7915$ and $4.2915$.

Now note that $\\text{gcd}(315, 525) = \\text{gcd}(315, 525 - 315) = \\text{gcd}(315, 210)$.

Simplifying these gives us $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 7$ and $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 5$. Adding these two equations together eliminates $ab$, giving us $2a^2 + 2b^2 = 12$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $a^2 + b^2 = 6$. Next, we multiply both sides of the original equations by themselves to get $(a+b)(a-b) = √(7)√(5)$. This simplifies to $a^2 - b^2 = √(35)$. Since we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 6$, we can substitute this into our equation to get $6 - b^2 = √(35)$. Solving for $b^2$ gives us $b^2 = 6 - √(35)$. Now, we have all the pieces needed to find $8ab(a^2 + b^2)$. Substituting the values we found earlier, we get $8ab(a^2 + b^2) = 8√(7)√(5)(6) = 8√(35)(6) = 24$. Therefore, $8ab(a^2 + b^2) = 24$.

In fact, we have $(3x)^2 + (4y)^2 + (2z)^2 - 2(3x)(4y) - 2(4y)(2z) + 2(3x)(2z) = [(3x)-(4y)+(2z)]^2$. Substituting $x=3$, $y=4$, and $z=5$, we get $[(3\\cdot3)-(4\\cdot4)+(2\\cdot5)]^2 = [9-16+10]^2 = [3]^2 = 9$. Therefore, the value of the expression is 9. The answer is 9"

Expanding, we have $a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 2a^3b + 2ab^3 = 16$. Subtracting twice the first equation from this gives $2a^3b + 2ab^3 - 8 = 0$. Factoring out a common factor of 2 gives $2(a^3b + ab^3) - 8 = 0$. Adding 8 to both sides gives $2(a^3b + ab^3) = 8$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $a^3b + ab^3 = 4$. Now, let's consider the expression $a^2 + b^2$. Squaring this gives $(a^2 + b^2)^2 = a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4$. Substituting the given values, we have $(a^2 + b^2)^2 = 8 - a^4$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $a^2 + b^2 = √(8 - a^4)$. Since we want the positive value of $a^2 + b^2$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = √(8 - a^4)$. Finally, substituting the value of $a^4$ from the first equation gives $a^2 + b^2 = √(8 - 8) = √(0) = 0$. Therefore, the value of $a^2 + b^2$ is 0. The answer is 0"

        "Explanation: We can rewrite the equation as $x^2 - x√(3) + 1 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x + (1)/(x) = -(-1)/(√(3)) = (1)/(√(3))$ and $x\\cdot(1)/(x) = 1$. Squaring both sides of the first equation gives us $(x + (1)/(x))^2 = (1)/(3)$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 2 + (1)/(x^2) = (1)/(3)$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us $x^2 - 2 + (1)/(x^2) = -(5)/(3)$. Multiplying this equation by $-(1)/(2)$ gives us $(1)/(2)(x^2 - 2 + (1)/(x^2)) = (5)/(6)$. Adding 1 to both sides gives us $(1)/(2)(x^2 - 2 + (1)/(x^2)) + 1 = (5)/(6) + 1$, which simplifies to $x^2 + (1)/(x^2) = (11)/(6)$. Finally, squaring both sides of this equation gives us $(x^2 + (1)/(x^2))^2 = \\left((11)/(6)\\right)^2$, which simplifies to $x^4 + 2 + (1)/(x^4) = (121)/(36)$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us $x^4 + (1)/(x^4) = (121)/(36) - 2 = (53)/(36)$. Therefore, $x^6 + (1)/(x^6) = (x^2 + (1)/(x^2))(x^4 + (1)/(x^4)) = (11)/(6) \\cdot (53)/(36) =\\frac{173{72}}$.

Then, we use the difference of squares factorization on $(a^8 + 1) - (a^4 + 1)$ to get $((a^4 + 1)^2 - 2(a^4 + 1) + 1) - (a^4 + 1)$. Next, we use the sum of cubes factorization on $(a^4 + 1)^3 - 2(a^4 + 1)$ to get $(a^4 + 1)((a^4 + 1)^2 - 2(a^4 + 1) + 1) - 2(a^4 + 1)$. Finally, we simplify this expression to get $a^4(a^4 + 1)(a^8 - a^4 - 2)$. Therefore, the factored form of $a^8 - a^4 - 2$ is a^4(a^4 + 1)(a^8 - a^4 - 2).

        "Explanation: To factorize the given expression, we can use the method of grouping terms and factoring out common factors from each group. The given expression is $x^2+4x^2+x-6$. We can rewrite this as $(x^2 + 4x^2) + x - 6$. Now, we can factor out a common factor of $x^2$ from the first two terms to get $x^2(1 + 4) + x - 6$, which simplifies to $5x^2 + x - 6$. Next, we can factorize this quadratic expression using the method of splitting the middle term. We need to find two numbers that multiply to $5 \\times -6 = -30$ and add up to $1$. These numbers are $6$ and $-5$. So, we can rewrite the middle term $x$ as $6x - 5x$. This gives us $5x^2 + 6x - 5x - 6$. Now, we can factorize by grouping to get $x(5x + 6) - 1(5x + 6)$. Finally, we can factor out the common binomial factor of $5x + 6$ to get $(5x + 6)(x - 1)$. Therefore, the factorization of the given expression is $(5x + 6)(x - 1)$. The answer is (5x+6)(x-1)"

To apply the sum of cubes formula, we need to rewrite $3a$ as $3\\cdot1 \\cdot a$, and $36$ as $3\\cdot12$. Then we can see that $a^3 + 3a + 36$ is very close to $(a+1)^3 - 1^3 + 36$. By expanding $(a+1)^3 - 1^3 + 36$, we get $a^3 + 3a + 36$, which matches our original expression. Therefore, we can write $a^3 + 3a + 36$ as $(a+1)^3 - 1^3 + 36$. Factoring further, we get $(a+1)^3 - 1^3 + 36 = [(a+1) - 1][(a+1)^2 + (a+1) + 1] + 36 = a(a^2 + 3a + 3) + 36$. So, the factorization of $a^3 + 3a + 36$ is a(a^2 + 3a + 3) + 36"

Notice that $(x - (1)/(x))^3$ expands to $x^3 - (1)/(x^3) - 3(x - (1)/(x))$. Therefore, we need to solve for $x - (1)/(x)$ first. From our given equation, we have $x + (1)/(x) = 3$. Squaring both sides gives us $x^2 + 2 + (1)/(x^2) = 9$. Rearranging terms, we get $x^2 - 7 + (1)/(x^2) = 0$. This implies that $x - (1)/(x) = √(7)$. Substituting this into our expression from before, we have $(x - (1)/(x))^3 = (√(7))^3 = 7√(7)$. Finally, subtracting $3(x - (1)/(x))$ from both sides gives us $x^3 - (1)/(x^3) = 7√(7) + 3(√(7)) = 10√(7)$. So the value of $x^3 - (1)/(x^3)$ is 10√(7)$. The answer is 10√(7)$"

        "Explanation: To solve this equation, we can use substitution. Let's set $y = 2^x$. Then the equation becomes $y + (1)/(y) = 3$. Multiplying both sides by $y$, we get $y^2 + 1 = 3y$. Rearranging terms, we have $y^2 - 3y + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm √(b^2 - 4ac)}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = -3$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $y = \\frac{3 \\pm √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(1))}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm √(5)}{2}$. Since $y = 2^x$, we have two possible solutions for $x$: $2^x = \\frac{3 + √(5)}{2}$ and $2^x = \\frac{3 - √(5)}{2}$. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we find that $x = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3 + √(5)}{2}\\right)$ and $x = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3 - √(5)}{2}\\right)$.

This means that $x$ raised to the power of $-2$ equals $(1)/(16)$. Since raising a number to the power of $-n$ is the same as taking its reciprocal raised to the power of $n$, we have $(x^{-1})^2 = ((1)/(16))^{1/2}$, which simplifies to $(1)/(x^2) = (1)/(4)$. Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives us $x^2 = 4$. Therefore, $x$ could be either $2$ or $-2$. However, since the base of a logarithm cannot be negative, the only valid solution is $x=2$. So, the value of $x$ is 2. The answer is \\text{2}$"

Expanding both sides, we have $xb^2 - ax^2 - ab^2 + a^3 = xa^2 - xb^2 - a^3 + b^3$. Rearranging terms, we get $ax^2 - bx^2 + a^3 - b^3 = xb^2 - xa^2$. Factoring out common factors, we have $x(a - b)(a + b) + (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 0$. Since $a$ and $b$ are distinct, we can divide both sides by $(a - b)$ to get $x(a + b) + (a^2 + ab + b^2) = 0$. Simplifying further, we have $xa + xb + a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0$. Rearranging terms again, we get $xa + xb + a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0$. We can rewrite this as $x(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 0$.

We know that the sum of the digits is $7$, which gives us the equation $x + y = 7$. Additionally, we have the second condition that the number formed by interchanging the digits is $9$ less than the original number, giving us the equation $10y + x = 10x + y - 9$. Combining these equations, we can solve for $x$ and $y$: From $x + y = 7$, we get $y = 7 - x$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $10(7 - x) + x = 10x + (7 - x) - 9$, which simplifies to $70 - 9x = 9x + 7 - 9$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 2$. Substituting this back into $y = 7 - x$, we find $y = 5$.

Similarly, the tangent function, $\\tan A$, is defined as $\\sin A/\\cos A$, and the cotangent function, $\\cot A$, is defined as $1/\\tan A$ or $\\cos A/\\sin A$. Therefore, we have $\\tan A/\\cot A = (\\sin A/\\cos A) / (\\cos A/\\sin A) = 1$. Combining these results, we find that $\\sec A/\\cos A - \\tan A/\\cot A = 1 - 1 = 0$.

Since there are 10 decigrams in a gram, the weight of 1 cubic centimeter of water is also 10 decigrams. To find the ratio of the weight of the wood to the weight of the water, we divide the weight of the wood (7 decigrams) by the weight of the water (10 decigrams). This gives us a ratio of 7:10, which simplifies to 7:10 when reduced to its lowest terms. To express this as a percentage, we multiply the ratio by 100, giving us 70%.

Since the ratio of the sides is $3:5:7$, we can express the sides in terms of a common factor $x$ such that $a = 3x$, $b = 5x$, and $c = 7x$. Substituting these expressions into the equation for the perimeter gives us $3x + 5x + 7x = 45$, which simplifies to $15x = 45$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x = 3$. Therefore, the lengths of the sides are $a = 3(3) = 9$ cm, $b = 5(3) = 15$ cm, and $c = 7(3) = 21$ cm. So, the lengths of the sides are 9 cm, 15 cm, and 21 cm"

We know that for every 3 units of paddy, we get 2 units of rice, so Rp = 2/3  Rice. Similarly, for every 4 units of wheat, we get 3 units of suzi, so Sw = 3/4  Wheat. Since we want to compare the amounts of rice and suzi produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat, we can set Rice = Wheat. Therefore, Rp = 2/3  Rice = 2/3  Wheat = Sw. Now, we have two ratios: Rp : Sw = 1 : 1 and Rx : Sx = ?. To find this ratio, we need to consider that both Rp and Sw were produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat, so their proportions should remain the same when compared to Rx and Sx.

        "Explanation: To check if these two equations are consistent or inconsistent, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I'll use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 2 on both sides to make the coefficients of $y$ in both equations equal. This gives us $-x + 2y = -2$. Now, add this new equation to the second equation. We get $(x - 2y) + (-x + 2y) = 2 + (-2)$, which simplifies to $0 = 0$. Since we got $0 = 0$, it means that the two equations are consistent and have infinitely many solutions. The two equations are also independent because they are not multiples of each other. Finally, since there is no specific value mentioned for $x$ or $y$, there is no unique solution for either variable.

The larger square has side length $a+10$, since the path has a width of 5 meters on both sides of the square. Therefore, the area of the path is $(a+10)^2 - a^2 = 500$. Expanding this equation gives $a^2 + 20a + 100 - a^2 = 500$, which simplifies to $20a + 100 = 500$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = (500 - 100)/(20) = 20$ meters.

According to the given ratio, we have $l = 21k$, $w = 16k$, and $h = 12k$ for some positive constant $k$. The length of the diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions: $d = √(l^2 + w^2 + h^2)$. Substituting the expressions for $l$, $w$, and $h$, we get $d = √((21k)^2 + (16k)^2 + (12k)^2) = k√(21^2 + 16^2 + 12^2) = k√(709)$.

We know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Therefore, we have the equation $4a = 2(l + w)$. Since the length of the rectangle is three times its width, we can substitute $l = 3w$ into the equation to get $4a = 2(3w + w)$, which simplifies to $4a = 8w$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us $a = 2w$. Now we also know that the area of the rectangle is given by $lw = 1200$, substituting $l = 3w$ again gives us $(3w)(w) = 1200$, which simplifies to $3w^2 = 1200$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us $w^2 = 400$, taking the square root of both sides gives us $w = 20$. Substituting this back into our equations for $a$ and $l$ gives us $a = 2w = 40$ and $l = 3w = 60$. So the perimeter of the rectangle is $2(l + w) = 2(60 + 20) = 160$.

Adding $1$ to an even number will always result in an odd number. And all perfect squares are either even or odd, but not both. Thus, $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1$ cannot be a perfect square unless it equals $1$. But if $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)=0$, then $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1=1$, which is a perfect square. So, when one is added to the product of $4$ consecutive natural numbers, the result is always a perfect square. Therefore, the statement \"when one is added to the product of $4$ consecutive natural numbers this is a perfect square\" is true"

Set A consists of prime numbers less than or equal to 5. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and themselves. So, $A = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$. Set B consists of even numbers less than or equal to 6. Even numbers are numbers divisible by 2. So, $B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$. Now, let's find out the intersection of sets A and B. This means we need to find out the common elements in both sets A and B. We can see that $A \\cap B = \\{2\\}$. Since $C = A \\setminus B$, this means all the elements in A which are not in B will be in C. So, $C = \\{3, 5\\}$. Now, let's consider the Cartesian product of these sets. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as $A \\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$. So, $(A \\cap C) \\times B = \\{(3, 2), (5, 2)\\}$.

Similarly, for making a profit of s%, we need to have S = C + sC/100. Combining these two equations, we get C - rC/100 = C + sC/100. Solving this equation for C gives us C = 100/(100 - r - s). Now, let x be the number of oranges to be sold per taka to make a profit of s%. Then we have C = xtaka/x oranges = 100/(100 - r - s)taka/orange. Solving for x gives us x = 100(100 - r - s)/(100 - r)"

Since the broken part makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ with the remaining part of the pole, we can use trigonometry to relate the length of the pole to the distance from the foot of the pole where it touches the ground. Specifically, we can use the tangent function, which relates the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the broken part of the pole ($x$), and the adjacent side is the distance from the foot of the pole to where it touches the ground (10 meters). Therefore, we have $\\tan(30^\\circ) = (x)/(10)$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 10\\tan(30^\\circ)$. Using the value of $\\tan(30^\\circ) = (1)/(√(3))$, we find $x = 10\\cdot(1)/(√(3)) = \\frac{10√(3)}{3}$. The total length of the pole is the sum of the lengths of the unbroken and broken parts, so the length of the pole is $x + 10 = \\frac{10√(3)}{3} + 10 = \\frac{10(√(3)+3)}{3}$.

Cross multiplying these equations gives us $ab = 3c$ and $bc = 6a$. Dividing these two equations gives us $a^2 / c^2 = 18/28 = 9/14$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $a/c = √(9/14) = 3/√(14)$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive, we know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ must all have the same sign. Therefore, we can multiply $a/c = 3/√(14)$ by $-1$ without changing the ratio, giving us $-a/c = -3/√(14)$. Multiplying this equation by $b$ on both sides gives us $-ab/c = -3b/√(14)$. Substituting $ab = 3c$ from the first equation into this equation gives us $-3c/c = -3b/√(14)$, which simplifies to $-3 = -3b/√(14)$. Solving for $b$ gives us $b = √(14)$. Finally, substituting $b = √(14)$ back into the original equations gives us $a = 3√(14)/4$ and $c = 14√(14)/4$. Therefore, $a : b : c = 3√(14)/4 : √(14) : 14√(14)/4 = 3 : 4 : 14$.

Plugging in the values, we get $a = √((500^2 - (12 \\times 10000)^2)/(2)) = √((250000 - 144 \\times 10000)/(2)) = √((250000 - 1440000)/(2)) = √((-1190000)/(2)) = i√(595000)$. Since the length cannot be imaginary, there seems to be a mistake in our calculations. However, upon further inspection, we realize that the negative sign under the square root indicates that the solution is complex, not real. This means that the given conditions are inconsistent, and no such rectangle exists. Therefore, the area of the given land in square meter is \\text{Unknown}$. The answer is \\text{Unknown}$"

Similarly, in the third month, he will deposit Tk. $(1300+100)$, i.e., Tk. $1400$, and so on. Thus, we see that this forms an A.P. having common difference as $100$ and first term as $1200$. Hence, using the formula for the nth term of an A.P., which is $a_n = a+(n−1)d$, where $a_n$ denotes the nth term, $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference and $n$ is the number of terms, we can find out how much he deposits in the $18$th month. Substituting $a=1200$, $d=100$ and $n=18$ into the formula, we get \\[a_{18} = 1200+(18−1)\\times100 = 1200+17\\times100 = 1200+1700 = 2900.\\] So, Rashid deposits Tk. $2900$ in the $18$th month. Now let's calculate how much he has deposited in all $18$ months. Using the sum of n terms of an A.P., given by $S_n=(n)/(2)(a+l)$, where $a$ is the first term, $l$ is the last term and $n$ is the total number of terms, substituting $a=1200$, $l=2900$ ($a_{18}$) and $n=18$ into the formula, we have \\[S_{18}=(18)/(2)\\left(1200+2900\\right)=9\\times4100=36900.\\] Therefore, Rashid deposits Tk. $36900$ in the first $18$ months.

Therefore, the radius is $(22)/(2)=11$. The formula for the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$, so the area of the full circle is $\\pi(11)^2=\\pi \\cdot 121$ square meters. Since the semicircle takes up half the space of the circle, its area is $(\\pi \\cdot 121)/(2)=(\\pi \\cdot 121)/(2)$ square meters. Adding this to the area of the square gives us the total area of the region as $484+(\\pi \\cdot 121)/(2)$ square meters.

The set $A$ described here is a set that contains all sets that do not contain themselves as members. However, if we assume that $A$ does not contain itself as a member, then according to the definition of $A$, it should contain itself as a member. This creates a paradox because if $A$ contains itself, then it does not contain itself, and if it does not contain itself, then it should contain itself. The resolution of this paradox lies in the fact that self-reference is not allowed in set theory, and thus, the set $A$ is considered undefined or ill-defined.

In this case, we have $7x - 2 - 3x^2 = 0$, which can be rewritten as $-3x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0$. Now we can identify $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a = -3$, $b = 7$, and $c = -2$. We can plug these values into the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm √(b^2 - 4ac)}{2a}.$$ Substituting the values for $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get: $$x = \\frac{-7 \\pm √(7^2 - 4(-3)(-2))}{2(-3)}.$$ Simplifying under the square root, we have: $$x = \\frac{-7 \\pm √(49 - 24)}{-6}.$$ Further simplifying, we get: $$x = \\frac{-7 \\pm √(25)}{-6}.$$ Taking the square root of 25, we have two possible solutions: $$x = (-7 \\pm 5)/(-6).$$ For the positive solution, we have: $$x = (-7 + 5)/(-6) = (-2)/(-6) = (1)/(3).$$ For the negative solution, we have: $$x = (-7 - 5)/(-6) = (-12)/(-6) = 2.$$ Therefore, the solutions to the equation are $x = (1)/(3)$ and $x = 2$.

Multiplying both sides by $y$, we get $y^2 + 1 = 26y$. Rearranging terms, we have $y^2 - 26y + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm √(b^2 - 4ac)}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = -26$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $y = \\frac{26 \\pm √((-26)^2 - 4(1)(1))}{2(1)} = \\frac{26 \\pm √(676 - 4)}{2} = \\frac{26 \\pm √(672)}{2} = \\frac{26 \\pm 4√(42)}{2} = 13 \\pm 2√(42)$. Since $y = 5^x$, we have two possible solutions for $x$: $5^x = 13 + 2√(42)$ and $5^x = 13 - 2√(42)$. Taking the logarithm base 5 of both sides, we find that $x = \\log_5 (13 + 2√(42))$ and $x = \\log_5 (13 - 2√(42))$.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get $(4)/(x) - 3 - 4 = (5)/(3(\\frac{4){x} - 3)}$. Simplifying, we have $(4)/(x) - 7 = (5)/(\\frac{12){x} - 9}$. Cross multiplying, we get $(4)(12) - 84x = 5x - (7)(9)(x)$. Expanding and simplifying, we have $48 - 84x = 5x - 63x$, which simplifies to $-48 = -52x$.

        "Explanation: We can solve this system of equations using substitution. From the second equation, we have $x^2 - y^2 = 3$, which can be rewritten as $(x+y)(x-y) = 3$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $(3)/(x+y) + (x-y)/(x+y) = (10)/(3)$. Combining the fractions on the left side gives us $(3+(x-y))/(x+y) = (10)/(3)$. Multiplying both sides by $3(x+y)$ gives us $9 + 3(x-y) = 10(x+y)$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $9 + 3x - 3y = 10x + 10y$. Bringing like terms together, we have $7x = 13y$. Dividing both sides by $y$, we get $(7x)/(y) = 13$. Since $x^2 - y^2 = 3$, we know that $x^2 > y^2$, so $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign. Therefore, we can take the positive square root of both sides of $(7x)/(y) = 13$ to find that $√((7x)/(y)) = √(13)$, or $\\frac{√(7x)}{√(y)} = √(13)$. Squaring both sides, we get $(7x)/(y) = 13$, which confirms our previous finding. Now we can substitute back into $x^2 - y^2 = 3$ to find that $(√(13))^2 - (√(7))^2 = 3$, or $13 - 7 = 3$. Thus, the solution to the system of equations is $x = √(13)$ and $y = √(7)$. The value of $(x+y)/(x-y)$ is therefore $\\frac{√(13)+√(7)}{√(13)-√(7)}$. Rationalizing the denominator, we get $\\frac{(√(13)+√(7))(√(13)+√(7))}{(√(13)-√(7))(√(13)+√(7))} = \\frac{13 + 2√(91) + 7}{13 - 7} = \\frac{20 + 2√(91)}{6} = \\frac{10 + √(91)}{3}$.

Also, we know that the diagonal of the rectangle is $√(l^2 + w^2) = 20$. Squaring both sides gives $l^2 + w^2 = 400$. We want to find the side length of the square whose area is equal to the area of the rectangle. Since the area of the rectangle is $lw$, the side length of the square is $√(lw)$. From our equations, we have $(l + w)^2 - 2lw = l^2 + w^2 = 400$, so $lw = ((l + w)^2)/(2) - 200 = 144$. Therefore, the side length of the square is $√(lw) = √(144) = 12$.

        "Explanation: Let $l$ and $b$ be the length and breadth respectively. Then we have $(1)/(2)(l+b) = lb + 10$. Squaring both sides gives us $(l+b)^2 = 4lb + 400 \\implies l^2 + b^2 + 2lb = 4lb + 400$, which simplifies to $l^2 - 2lb + b^2 = 400 \\implies (l-b)^2 = 400.$ Therefore, $l-b = 20$ or $l-b=-20$. Since $l > b$, we get that $l=b+20$. Substituting this into our original equation from above yields $$(1)/(2) (2b+20)=b(b+20)+10\\Rightarrow b^2+10b=0.$$ Thus, $b(b+10)=0$ so either $b=0$ or $b=-10$. We discard these solutions as lengths aren't negative but for $b=0$ we find that $l=20$. Hence the dimensions of the rectangle are $20m$ and $0m$. This doesn't make sense given the context of the question however since there can't be a zero dimensioned side, therefore we take $b=10$ which implies $l=30$. So the dimensions of the rectangle are $30m$ and $10m$. The answer is \\text{Length: 30\\text{ m}\\text{, Breadth: }10\\text{ m}}$. \\text{Length: 30\\text{ m}\\text{, Breadth: }10\\text{ m}}$"

The problem states that the angles are in arithmetic progression, which means $b - a = c - b$. Also, the largest angle is twice the smallest angle, so $c = 2a$. We can substitute these conditions into the equation for the sum of the angles to get $a + (a + d) + (2a + d) = \\pi$, where $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic progression. Simplifying this gives $4a + 2d = \\pi$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $2a + d = (\\pi)/(2)$. Now we know that $d = (\\pi)/(2) - 2a$. Substituting this back into the condition $c = 2a$ gives $c = 2a = (2\\pi)/(3)$, and substituting it back into the condition $b - a = c - b$ gives $b = (5\\pi)/(6)$.

Let $a = (\\pi)/(12)$, $b = (5\\pi)/(12)$, $c = (7\\pi)/(12)$, and $d = (11\\pi)/(12)$. Then we have \\[\\tan a \\tan d = \\tan b \\tan c.\\] Using the identity again, we get \\[(\\tan a + \\tan d)/(1 - \\tan a \\tan d) = (\\tan b + \\tan c)/(1 - \\tan b \\tan c).\\] Simplifying this equation gives \\[1 - \\tan a \\tan d = 1 - \\tan b \\tan c,\\] so $\\tan a \\tan d = \\tan b \\tan c$. Since all the angles are between $0$ and $\\pi$, the tangent function is positive, so we can take the square root of both sides to get \\[√(\\tan a \\tan d) = √(\\tan b \\tan c).\\] This simplifies to $\\tan a \\tan d = \\tan b \\tan c$. Therefore, the product of the tangents of every two consecutive angles is equal to the product of the tangents of the other two angles. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the products of the tangents taken two at a time is equal to the product of the sums of the tangents taken two at a time. Thus, \\[\\tan a \\tan b + \\tan b \\tan c + \\tan c \\tan a = (\\tan a + \\tan b)(\\tan b + \\tan c).\\] Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ gives \\[(\\tan (\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (5\\pi)/(12))(\\tan (5\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (7\\pi)/(12)) = \\tan (\\pi)/(12) \\tan (5\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (5\\pi)/(12) \\tan (7\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (7\\pi)/(12) \\tan (\\pi)/(12).\\] Since $\\tan x = \\tan (x + n\\pi)$ for any integer $n$, we have \\[\\tan (\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (5\\pi)/(12) = \\tan (5\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (7\\pi)/(12) = \\tan (7\\pi)/(12) + \\tan (\\pi)/(12).\\] Therefore, the left side of the equation is equal to the right side, and the equality holds true.

We know that the formula for the circumference of a circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Here $\\pi$ is approximately taken as $3.14$. Substituting the value of the radius into the formula gives us the total distance travelled as $2 \\times 3.14 \\times 6440 = 40100.8$ kilometers. Now each revolution of the wheel covers a distance equal to its own circumference. The circumference of the wheel can be calculated using the formula $C=\\pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the wheel. Substituting the given value of the diameter into this equation yields $C=3.14 \\times 0.84 = 2.64$ meters. To convert this into kilometers since our other distances are in kilometers, we divide by $1000$ giving $0.00264$ kilometers per revolution. Finally, dividing the total distance by the distance covered by each revolution gives us the number of revolutions needed. This calculation results in $40100.8 \\div 0.00264 = 15197200$ revolutions.

        "Explanation: We can rewrite the given equation as $a^2 = 3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)} - 2$. Taking the cube of both sides gives us $(a^2)^3 = (3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)} - 2)^3$. Expanding this expression using the binomial theorem, we get $a^6 - 6(a^2)(3^{(1)/(3)})(3^{-(1)/(3)}) + 3(a^2)^2(3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)} - 2) - 8(a^2) + 12 = 0$. Simplifying further, we have $a^6 - 6a^2 + 3(a^2)^2(3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)} - 2) - 8a^2 + 12 = 0$. Notice that $3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)} - 2 = (3^{(1)/(3)} + 3^{-(1)/(3)})^2 - 4 = a^2 - 4$. Substituting this into our equation, we obtain $a^6 - 6a^2 + 3(a^2)^2(a^2 - 4) - 8a^2 + 12 = 0$. This simplifies to $a^6 - 14a^4 + 48a^2 - 24 = 0$. Factoring out an $a^2$, we have $a^2(a^4 - 14a^2 + 48) - 24 = 0$. The quadratic factor $a^4 - 14a^2 + 48$ factors further as $(a^2 - 6)(a^2 - 8)$. Thus, we have $a^2(a^2 - 6)(a^2 - 8) - 24 = 0$. Since $a \\ge 0$, we know that $a^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, for the product $a^2(a^2 - 6)(a^2 - 8)$ to equal $-24$, either two of the factors must be negative while the remaining factor is positive, or all three factors must be negative. However, since $a^2 - 6 > a^2 - 8$, it follows that $a^2(a^2 - 6)(a^2 - 8) > 0$ when $a^2 > 6$. Hence, none of the factors can be negative. Consequently, the only possibility left is that $a^2 = 6$, which implies $a = √(6)$. Substituting this back into the original equation, we find that $√(6)^2 + 2 = 3^{(2)/(3)} + 3^{-(2)/(3)}$, confirming that $a = √(6)$ is indeed a valid solution. Finally, substituting $a = √(6)$ into the desired equation $3a^3 + 9a = 8$, we obtain $3(√(6))^3 + 9√(6) = 8$, which simplifies to $18√(6) + 9√(6) = 8$, yielding $27√(6) = 8$, or $3a^3 + 9a = 8$"

So we have $(4)/(3)\\pi(6^3 + 8^3 + r^3) = (4)/(3)\\pi R^3$, where $R$ is the radius of the new sphere. Cancelling out the common factors on both sides gives us $216 + 512 + r^3 = R^3$. Since all the spheres were made from the same material, they should have the same density, which means that the total volume of the smaller spheres equals the volume of the larger sphere. Therefore, we can equate the sum of the volumes of the smaller spheres to the volume of the larger sphere, giving us $r^3 = R^3 - 728$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives us $r = \\sqrt[3]{R^3 - 728}$. Substituting $R = 10$ (since the sum of the radii of the smaller spheres is equal to the diameter of the larger sphere), we get $r = \\sqrt[3]{1000 - 728} = \\sqrt[3]{272}$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ represents the hypotenuse (the slant height), and $a$ and $b$ represent the other two sides. Plugging in the values, we get $25^2 + 8^2 = c^2$. Simplifying, we have $625 + 64 = c^2$, which gives us $689 = c^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $c = √(689)$.

The base circumference is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the base, which is half the diameter, so $r = (50)/(2) = 25$ m. The slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, since it forms a right triangle with the height and radius of the base. So, the slant height is $√(h^2 + r^2) = √(8^2 + 25^2) = √(64 + 625) = √(689)$ m. Therefore, the lateral surface area of the tent is $(1)/(2) \\times 2\\pi \\times 25 \\times √(689) = 25\\pi√(689)$ square metres. Adding the area of the base, we get the total surface area as $(25\\pi√(689) + 25\\pi)$ square metres.

Similarly, when $P(x)$ is divided by $x - b$, the remainder is equal to $P(b)$. Since both divisions yield the same remainder, we have $P(a) = P(b)$. Substituting the expression for $P(x)$, we get $(a^3 + 5a^2 + 6a + 8) = (b^3 + 5b^2 + 6b + 8)$. Simplifying this equation gives us $a^3 - b^3 + 5a^2 - 5b^2 + 6a - 6b = 0$. Factoring out common terms, we obtain $(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2 + 5a + 5b + 6) = 0$. Since $a \\neq b$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(a - b)$ to get $a^2 + ab + b^2 + 5a + 5b + 6 = 0$.

Therefore, we have two possible values for $y$: $$y_1 = (a^3 + a + a)/(2) = (a^3 + 2a)/(2), \\quad y_2 = (a^3 + a - a)/(2) = (a^3)/(2).$$ Substituting back $y = a^x$, we have two possible solutions for $x$: $$x_1 = \\log_a \\left((a^3 + 2a)/(2)\\right), \\quad x_2 = \\log_a \\left((a^3)/(2)\\right).$$ The solution set is $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$. Thus, the answer is \\begin{cases\\log_a \\left((a^3 + 2a)/(2)\\right) \\\\ \\log_a \\left((a^3)/(2)\\right) \\end{cases}}$. The answer is \\begin{cases\\log_a \\left((a^3 + 2a)/(2)\\right) \\\\ \\log_a \\left((a^3)/(2)\\right) \\end{cases}}$"

For such a series to have a sum to infinity, its common ratio must satisfy $|r|<1$, where $r$ is the common ratio. Therefore, we have $|(1)/(2x+1)|<1$. Solving this inequality gives $-1<(1)/(2x+1)<1$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $(2x+1)$ changes the direction of the middle part of the inequality because $2x+1$ is negative for $x<-(1)/(2)$. So we get $-1(2x+1)<1(2x+1)$, which simplifies to $-2x-1<2x+1$. Adding $-2x$ to both sides gives $-4x-1<1$, and adding $1$ to both sides gives $-4x<2$. Dividing both sides by $-4$ reverses the direction of the inequality because $-4$ is negative, so we get $x>-(1)/(2)$.

        "Explanation: The volume of the iron sphere remains constant after flattening. Let's denote the radius of the iron sphere as $r$, which is half of its diameter, so $r = (4)/(2) = 2$ cm. The volume of the sphere is given by $(4)/(3)\\pi r^3$. After flattening into a circular iron sheet of thickness $t = (2)/(3)$ cm., the volume of the sheet can be calculated as the product of its area and its thickness. Since the width of the sheet is not specified, we will denote it as $w$. Therefore, the volume of the sheet is $wt$. Setting these two volumes equal gives us the equation $(4)/(3)\\pi r^3 = wt$. We know that $w = 2\\pi R$, where $R$ is the radius of the sheet. Substituting this into the equation gives $(4)/(3)\\pi r^3 = 2\\pi R t$. Solving for $R$ gives $R = (2r^3)/(3t)$.
