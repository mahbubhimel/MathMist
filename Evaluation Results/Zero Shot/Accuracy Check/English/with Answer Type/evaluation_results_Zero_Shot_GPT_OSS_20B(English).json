The ground truth is the identity itself, while the student answer includes a specific case where $A = 30^\\circ$ and states that both sides equal $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence using appropriate methods.  \nThe identity $\\tan 2A = \\frac{2\\tan A}{1 - \\tan^2 A}$ is a well-known trigonometric identity. When $A = 30^\\circ$, $\\tan A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, so $\\tan 2A = \\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}$. Substituting into the identity:  \n$$\n\\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThus, both sides of the identity are equal when $A = 30^\\circ$, and the identity itself is correct.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.  \nThe student answer includes a specific case ($A = 30^\\circ$) and states that both sides equal $\\sqrt{3}$, while the ground truth is the general identity. However, the identity is valid for all $A$ where it is defined, and the specific case is a valid application of the identity.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.  \nThe student answer correctly applies the identity to a specific case and shows that both sides are equal, which is consistent with the ground truth identity.\n\n<<END_THINK"
