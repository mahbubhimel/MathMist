    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To prove that $\\sqrt{7}$ is irrational, we will use proof by contradiction. We assume that $\\sqrt{7}$ is rational and derive a contradiction.\n\nIf $\\sqrt{7}$ is rational, then it can be expressed as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are coprime), and $b \\neq 0$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{a}{b}$, we get $7 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$. Multiplying both sides by $b^2$, we have $7b^2 = a^2$. This means that $a^2$ is divisible by 7, so $a$ must also be divisible by 7 (since 7 is prime). Let's say $a = 7k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 7k$ into the equation $7b^2 = a^2$, we get $7b^2 = (7k)^2$, which simplifies to $b^2 = 7k^2$. This means that $b^2$ is divisible by 7, so $b$ must also be divisible by 7.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our assumption that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors other than 1.

The product of these two numbers is $(2n)(2n+2) = 4n^2 + 4n$. This expression can be factored as $4n(n+1)$. Since $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be even.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: A repeating decimal fraction can be expressed as a fraction by using a little algebra. For example, let's take the number $0.\\dot{6}$. We can set up the equation $x = 0.\\dot{6}$, and then multiply both sides by 10 to get $10x = 6.\\dot{6}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9x = 6$, so $x = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow let's apply this method to the given numbers:\n\n$5.\\dot{7}$: Let $x = 5.\\dot{7}$, then $10x = 57.\\dot{7}$. Subtracting these equations gives $9x = 52$, so $x = \\frac{52}{9}$.\n\n$8.\\dot{3}\\dot{4}$: Let $x = 8.\\dot{3}\\dot{4}$, then $100x = 834.\\dot{3}\\dot{4}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To prove that $\\sqrt{5}$ is an irrational number, we will use proof by contradiction. We assume that $\\sqrt{5}$ is a rational number and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that $\\sqrt{5}$ is a rational number. This means that it can be expressed as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are coprime), and $b \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{5} = \\frac{a}{b}$:\n\n$(\\sqrt{5})^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$5 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $b^2$, we get:\n\n$5b^2 = a^2$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $a^2$ is divisible by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, this implies that $a$ itself must be divisible by 5 (because if $a$ were not divisible by 5, then $a^2$ would not be divisible by 5). So, we can write $a = 5k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 5k$ into the equation $5b^2 = a^2$, we get:\n\n$5b^2 = (5k)^2$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$5b^2 = 25k^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n$b^2 = 5k^2$\n\nThis shows that $b^2$ is also divisible by 5, which implies that $b$ is divisible by 5.\n\nHowever, we initially assumed that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors other than 1. But now we have shown that both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 5, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that $\\sqrt{5}$ is a rational number must be false.\n\nHence, $\\sqrt{5}$ is an irrational number.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{<final>Answer: }}$.",

So $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{c}{a}$. But since $a+c=0$, this means that $x=-y$. Thus, $(x, y) = (-y, y)$.\nCase 2: $a-c=0$. Then from $ax-cy=0$, we get $ax=cy$. So $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{c}{a}$. But since $a-c=0$, this means that $x=y$. Thus, $(x, y) = (y, y)$.\nTherefore, the solutions for $(x, y)$ are all pairs of the form $(-y, y)$ and $(y, y)$.

Taking the union of these two sets gives us all unique factors from both numbers, so $A \\cup B = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 35, 45\\}$. Taking the intersection of these two sets gives us the factors that are common to both numbers, so $A \\cap B = \\{1, 5\\}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, let's find out how many students passed in English. We know that 48 students passed in both Bangla and English, so these 48 students are counted twice in the total of 65 students who passed in Bangla.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, we need to find the elements of sets $B$ and $C$.\n\nFor set $B$, we have $3 < x < 6$. The natural numbers that satisfy this inequality are $4$ and $5$. So, $B = \\{4, 5\\}$.\n\nFor set $C$, we have $x^2 > 5$ and $x^3 < 130$. Solving these inequalities, we get $x > \\sqrt{5}$ and $x < \\sqrt[3]{130}$. Since $x$ is a natural number, the possible values for $x$ are those greater than $\\sqrt{5}$ but less than $\\sqrt[3]{130}$. Checking these values, we find that $x = 3$ and $x = 4$ satisfy both conditions. So, $C = \\{3, 4\\}$.\n\nNow, let's find $B \\times C$. This is the Cartesian product of sets $B$ and $C$, which consists of all ordered pairs $(b, c)$ where $b \\in B$ and $c \\in C$.

Therefore, $b = 6$ or $b = -10$.\n\nIf $b = 6$, then from the first equation $a = 10$. If $b = -10$, then from the first equation $a = -6$.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs of $(a, b)$ are $(10, 6)$ and $(-6, -10)$.

    "question": "If $a-b=5$ and $ab=36$, find the value of\n(a) $a^2+ab+b^2$ and (b) $a^3-b^3$.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can use the given equations to solve for $a$ and $b$. From $a - b = 5$, we have $a = b + 5$. Substituting this into $ab = 36$, we get $(b + 5)b = 36$. Expanding, we have $b^2 + 5b = 36$. Rearranging, we get $b^2 + 5b - 36 = 0$. Factoring, we have $(b - 4)(b + 9) = 0$. So, $b = 4$ or $b = -9$. Since $a = b + 5$, we have $a = 9$ or $a = -4$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expressions. For part (a), we have $a^2 + ab + b^2$. Plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$, we get two possible solutions: $(9)^2 + (9)(4) + (4)^2 = 81 + 36 + 16 = 133$ or $(-4)^2 + (-4)(-9) + (-9)^2 = 16 + 36 + 81 = 133$. Therefore, $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 133$.\n\nFor part (b), we have $a^3 - b^3$. Again, plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$, we get two possible solutions: $(9)^3 - (4)^3 = 729 - 64 = 665$ or $(-4)^3 - (-9)^3 = -64 - (-729) = 665$. Therefore, $a^3 - b^3 = 665$.\n\nThe answers are $\\boxed{133}$ and $\\boxed{665}$. The final solution is $\\boxed{\\text{<final>133</final>, <final>665</final>}}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can rewrite the given equation as $m^2 - am + 1 = 0$. Then we can use the formula for the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation to find that $m_1 m_2 = 1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = a$. Squaring both sides of the second equation gives $(m_1 + m_2)^2 = a^2$, which simplifies to $m_1^2 + 2m_1 m_2 + m_2^2 = a^2$. Substituting $m_1 m_2 = 1$ into this equation gives $a^2 - 2 + a^2 = a^2$, so $a^2 = 2$. Therefore, $m^3 + \\frac{1}{m^3} = (m + \\frac{1}{m})(m^2 - 1 + \\frac{1}{m^2}) = a(a^2 - 3) = a(2 - 3) = -a$.

Substituting $x - \\frac{1}{x} = p$, we have $p^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} - 2$. Adding 2 to both sides gives us $p^2 + 2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$. Multiplying both sides by $x^2$ gives us $p^2x^2 + 2x^2 = x^4 + 1$. Rearranging terms, we get $x^4 - p^2x^2 + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x^2$.

Then, we use the difference of squares factorization on $(a^8 + 1) - (a^4 + 1)$ to get $((a^4 + 1)^2 - 2(a^4 + 1) + 1) - (a^4 + 1)$. Next, we use the sum of cubes factorization on $(a^4 + 1)^3 - 2(a^4 + 1)$ to get $(a^4 + 1)((a^4 + 1)^2 - 2(a^4 + 1) + 1) - 2(a^4 + 1)$. Finally, we simplify this expression to get $a^4(a^4 + 1)(a^8 - a^4 - 2)$. Therefore, the factored form of $a^8 - a^4 - 2$ is a^4(a^4 + 1)(a^8 - a^4 - 2).

We can rewrite this as $(x^2 + 4x^2) + x - 6$. Now, we can factor out a common factor of $x^2$ from the first two terms to get $x^2(1 + 4) + x - 6$, which simplifies to $5x^2 + x - 6$. Next, we can factorize this quadratic expression using the method of splitting the middle term. We need to find two numbers that multiply to $5 \\times -6 = -30$ and add up to $1$. These numbers are $6$ and $-5$. So, we can rewrite the middle term $x$ as $6x - 5x$. This gives us $5x^2 + 6x - 5x - 6$. Now, we can factorize by grouping to get $x(5x + 6) - 1(5x + 6)$. Finally, we can factor out the common binomial factor of $5x + 6$ to get $(5x + 6)(x - 1)$. Therefore, the factorization of the given expression is $(5x + 6)(x - 1)$. The answer is (5x+6)(x-1)"

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the number of passengers as x. According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) The total cost of the bus hire is divided equally among all passengers, so each passenger pays 5700 / x dollars.\n2) Due to the absence of 5 passengers, the fare was increased by 3 dollars per head, so each remaining passenger pays (5700 / (x - 5)) + 3 dollars.\n\nSince both expressions represent the same amount paid by each passenger, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n5700 / x = (5700 / (x - 5)) + 3\n\nTo simplify this equation, let's multiply through by x(x - 5) to eliminate the denominators:\n\n5700(x - 5) = 5700x + 3x(x - 5)\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms gives us a quadratic equation:\n\n5700x - 28500 = 5700x + 3x^2 - 15x\n\nSubtracting 5700x from both sides and rearranging again gives:\n\n3x^2 - 15x - 28500 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation does not factor easily, so we will use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -15, and c = -28500. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nx = (15 ± √((-15)^2 - 4*3*(-28500))) / (2*3)\n\nx = (15 ± √(225 + 342000)) / 6\n\nx = (15 ± √342225) / 6\n\nx = (15 ± 585) / 6\n\nWe discard the negative solution because it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. So we have:\n\nx = (15 + 585) / 6\n\nx = 600 / 6\n\nx = 100\n\nSo there were originally 100 passengers who availed the bus. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{100}$.",

Therefore, we have the equation $(b - c) \\cdot p = d$.\n\nWhen going with the current, the effective speed of the boat is $b + c$ km/h. Therefore, we have the equation $(b + c) \\cdot q = d$.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously for $b$ and $c$. Dividing both sides of the first equation by $p$, we get $b - c = \\frac{d}{p}$. Adding this to the second equation multiplied by $\\frac{1}{q}$, we get $b - c + b + c = \\frac{d}{p} + \\frac{d}{q}$.

According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) When going downstream (with the current), the speed of the boat increases, so the equation for this case is: 5 = (x + y) * t, where t is the time taken.\n2) When going upstream (against the current), the speed of the boat decreases, so the equation for this case is: 3 = (x - y) * t.\n\nWe know that the total time taken for the round trip is 4 hours, which means that the time taken for each leg of the trip (going downstream and coming upstream) is 4/2 = 2 hours.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equations, we get:\n\n1) 5 = (x + y) * 2 => x + y = 5/2\n2) 3 = (x - y) * 2 => x - y = 3/2\n\nAdding these two equations together, we get: 2x = 8/2 => x = 4 km/h.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 2y = 2/2 => y = 1 km/h.\n\nSo, the speed of the oar is 4 km/h and the speed of the current is 1 km/h.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>Answer: The speed of the oar is 4 km/h and the speed of the current is 1 km/h.</final>}$.",

We know from the problem that when the commodity is sold at a loss of x%, the selling price is given by S = C - x% * C. Similarly, when the commodity is sold at a profit of 3x%, the selling price is given by S = C + 3x% * C. According to the problem, these two selling prices differ by $18x, so we can set up the equation:\n\nC - x% * C = C + 3x% * C - $18x\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n0 = 4x% * C - $18x\n\nDividing both sides by 4x% gives us:\n\nC = $18x / 4x%\n\nSince % means per hundred, we can rewrite 4x% as 4x/100.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the principal as P. The simple interest for two years would be given by I = PRT/100, where R is the rate of interest and T is the time in years. In this case, we have R = 4% and T = 2 years. So, the simple interest would be I = P * 4 * 2 / 100 = 0.08P.\nThe compound interest can be calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after n years, r is the annual interest rate, t is the number of years, and n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. However, since we are asked about the difference between simple and compound interest, we can simplify our calculations by considering just the first year of compounding. This gives us A = P(1 + r) - P = Pr, which in this case equals P * 4/100 = 0.04P.\nGiven that the difference between the simple and compound interest is 1, we have 0.08P - 0.04P = 1, which simplifies to 0.04P = 1. Solving for P, we get P = 1 / 0.04 = 25. Therefore, the principal is 25.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{25}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>25</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the principal as P, the rate of profit as r, and the time as t. According to the formula for simple interest, we have:\n\nP + Prt = Total amount after t years\n\nWe can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1) P + 3Pr = 460\n2) P + 5Pr = 600\n\nNow, let's solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by P:\n\n1 + 3r = 460 / P\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify equation 2:\n\n1 + 5r = 600 / P\n\nNow, we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(1 + 5r) - (1 + 3r) = (600 / P) - (460 / P)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2r = 140 / P\n\nNow, we can solve for r:\n\nr = (140 / P) / 2\n\nSince we don't know the value of P, we cannot find the exact numerical value of r.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The formula for calculating simple interest is I = PRT/100, where P is the principal amount ($8000), R is the annual interest rate (5%), T is the time in years (3), and I is the interest earned.

So, the new total cost of hiring the bus can also be expressed as (N - 10)(F + 8), which equals 2400 according to the problem.\n\nNow let's solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express F in terms of N: F = 2400 / N. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n(N - 10)(2400 / N + 8) = 2400\n\nMultiplying through by N to clear the fraction, we get:\n\n2400 + 8N - 24000/N - 80 = 2400\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8N - 24000/N = 80\n\nMultiplying through by N again to clear the fraction, we get:\n\n8N^2 - 24000 = 80N\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n8N^2 - 80N - 24000 = 0\n\nDividing through by 8 to simplify, we get:\n\nN^2 - 10N - 3000 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation factors as:\n\n(N - 60)(N + 50) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are N = 60 and N = -50. Since the number of passengers cannot be negative, we discard the solution N = -50. Therefore, the original number of passengers was N = 60.\n\nSubstituting N = 60 back into the equation F = 2400 / N, we find that the original fare per head was F = 2400 / 60 = 40 taka.\n\nDue to the absence of 10 passengers, the fare was increased by Tk. 8 per head, so the new fare per head became F + 8 = 40 + 8 = 48 taka.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of absent passengers using the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of absent passengers / Original number of passengers) * 100%\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nPercentage = (10 / 60) * 100% = 16.67%\n\nTherefore, the increased fare per head is Tk. 48 and the percentage of absent passengers is 16.67%.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>Answer: The increased fare per head is Tk. 48 and the percentage of absent passengers is 16.67%</final>}$.",

    "question": "A bus was hired at Tk. 2400 to go for a picnic under the condition that every passenger would bare equal fare. But due to the absence of 10 passengers, the fare was increased by Tk. 8 per head.\nDetermine the fare per head of the passengers.\n",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let x be the number of passengers and y be the original fare per head. We have two equations from the given information: xy = 2400 and (x - 10)(y + 8) = 2400. Expanding the second equation gives us xy + 8x - 10y - 80 = 2400. Since we know that xy = 2400, this simplifies to 2400 + 8x - 10y - 80 = 2400, which further simplifies to 8x - 10y - 80 = 0. Solving these two equations simultaneously will lead us to the values of x and y. From the first equation, we can express y as y = 2400 / x. Substituting this into the second equation gives us 8x - 10(2400 / x) - 80 = 0. Multiplying through by x to clear the fraction gives us 8x^2 - 24000 - 80x = 0. Rearranging terms gives us 8x^2 - 80x - 24000 = 0. Dividing through by 8 gives us x^2 - 10x - 3000 = 0. Factoring this quadratic gives us (x - 60)(x + 50) = 0. Therefore, x = 60 or x = -50. Since the number of passengers cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -50. So there were originally 60 passengers. Substituting x = 60 back into the equation y = 2400 / x gives us y = 2400 / 60 = 40. Therefore, the original fare per head was $40. The additional question asks what the new fare per head is after 10 passengers fail to show up. This is found by dividing the total cost by the new number of passengers, so it is 2400 / 50 = $48.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>48</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the original number of passengers as N and the original fare per head as F. According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) The total cost of the bus hire is the product of the number of passengers and the fare per head, so NF = 2400.\n\n2) Due to the absence of 10 passengers, the fare was increased by Tk. 8 per head. This means that (N - 10)(F + 8) = 2400.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of N and F.\n\nFrom equation 1), we can express F in terms of N: F = 2400 / N.\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2), we get (N - 10)(2400 / N + 8) = 2400.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we obtain 2400 + 8N - 24000/N - 80 = 2400.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 8N - 24000/N = 80.\n\nMultiplying through by N to clear the fraction, we get 8N^2 - 24000 = 80N.\n\nRearranging, we get 8N^2 - 80N - 24000 = 0.\n\nDividing through by 8 to simplify, we get N^2 - 10N - 3000 = 0.\n\nThis quadratic equation does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nN = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -10, and c = -3000. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nN = (10 ± √((-10)^2 - 4*1*(-3000))) / 2*1\nN = (10 ± √(100 + 12000)) / 2\nN = (10 ± √12100) / 2\nN = (10 ± 110) / 2\n\nThe two possible solutions are N = 60 and N = -50. Since the number of passengers cannot be negative, we discard the second solution and take N = 60.\n\nNow we can find the original fare per head: F = 2400 / N = 2400 / 60 = 40.\n\nSo originally there were 60 passengers paying Tk. 40 each. When 10 passengers failed to pay, the remaining 50 passengers had to bear an additional Tk. 8 each, making their new fare Tk. 48.\n\nThe difference between the original fare and the new fare is Tk. 8, which represents the extra money collected from each of the absent passengers.\n\nTo calculate the simple profit and compound profit, we need to know how much money was invested initially and what the interest rate is.

Simplifying further, we have $xa + xb + a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0$. Rearranging terms again, we get $xa + xb + a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0$. We can rewrite this as $x(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 0$. Factoring out a common factor of $(a + b)$, we have $(a + b)(x + a + b) = 0$. Therefore, either $a + b = 0$ or $x + a + b = 0$. In the first case, since $a$ and $b$ are distinct, there is no solution for $x$. In the second case, solving for $x$, we find that $x = -(a + b)$. Thus, the solution to the given equation is -(a + b)"

Then, xy = 10x + y.\nTherefore, xy - yx = 45 <=> xy - yx = 5(9) => xy - yx = 5(10+y-x).\n=> xy - yx = 50 + 5y - 5x => 2xy - 50 = 5y - 5x.\nAdding 50 on both sides, we get 2xy = 5y - 5x + 50.\nTaking out 5 as common factor on right side, we get 2xy = 5(y - x + 10).\nDividing each term by 2, we get xy = 5(y - x + 10)/2.\nMultiplying each term by 2 again, we get 2xy = 5(y - x + 10).\nExpanding the above equation, we get 2xy = 5y - 5x + 50.\nSubtracting 5y from each side, we get 2xy - 5y = -5x + 50.\nRearranging terms, we get 2xy - 5y + 5x = 50.\nFactoring out x and y respectively, we get x(2y - 5) + (2y - 5) = 50.\nTaking out (2y - 5) as common factor, we get (2y - 5)(x + 1) = 50.\nSince x and y are digits, so they can take values between 0 to 9. Also, since sum of digits is 9, therefore possible combinations for (x, y) would be either (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1) and (9, 0).

Substituting $a = 2b$ into the equation gives $10(2b) + b = 7(2b + b)$, which simplifies to $20b + b = 14b + 7b$, further simplifying to $21b = 21b$. This equation holds true for all values of $b$, so the number is indeed seven times the sum of its digits. Therefore, the statement is proven.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>seven times the sum of the digits.</final>}$.",

    "question": "Number of passengers in a launch is 47. The fare per head for the cabin is twice that for the deck. The fare per head for the deck is Tk. 30. If the total fare collected is Tk. 1680, what is the number of passengers in the cabin?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the number of passengers in the cabin as C and the number of passengers on the deck as D. We know from the problem that C + D = 47. Also, we know that the fare per head for the cabin is twice that for the deck, so let's denote the fare per head for the deck as Fd and the fare per head for the cabin as Fc. From this, we have Fc = 2Fd. Finally, we know that the total fare collected is Tk. 1680, which can be expressed as Fc*C + Fd*D = 1680.\n\nWe can substitute Fc = 2Fd into the equation above to get 2Fd*C + Fd*D = 1680. Since Fd is a common factor, we can factor it out to get Fd*(2C + D) = 1680. We also know from the problem that D = 47 - C, so we can substitute this into our equation to get Fd*(2C + 47 - C) = 1680. Simplifying this gives us Fd*(C + 47) = 1680.\n\nWe know from the problem that the fare per head for the deck is Tk. 30, so we can substitute Fd = 30 into our equation to get 30*(C + 47) = 1680. Solving this equation for C gives us C = (1680 / 30) - 47 = 56 - 47 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 passengers in the cabin.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>9</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the distance covered at the speed of 60 km/h as x km. Then the distance covered at the speed of 40 km/h would be (240 - x) km. We know that time = distance / speed, so we can write two equations for the time spent on each part of the journey:\n\n1) Time spent on first part = x / 60\n2) Time spent on second part = (240 - x) / 40\n\nThe total time spent on the journey is given as 5 hours. So we have the equation:\n\nx / 60 + (240 - x) / 40 = 5\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to get rid of the fractions. We can do this by multiplying every term by 120 (the least common multiple of 60 and 40):\n\n2x + 3(240 - x) = 600\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2x + 720 - 3x = 600\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-x + 720 = 600\n\nSubtract 720 from both sides:\n\n-x = -120\n\nMultiply by -1 to solve for x:\n\nx = 120\n\nSo the car passed over 120 km at the speed of 60 km/h.

Substituting the expressions for the base and the height into the formula gives us:\n\n810 = 1/2 * (2h + 6) * h\n\nSolving this equation will give us the height of the triangle. First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n1620 = (2h + 6) * h\n\nExpanding the right side gives:\n\n1620 = 2h^2 + 6h\n\nRearranging terms to form a quadratic equation:\n\n2h^2 + 6h - 1620 = 0\n\nDividing all terms by 2 simplifies the equation further:\n\nh^2 + 3h - 810 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. Here, a = 1, b = 3, and c = -810. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nh = (-3 ± √(3^2 - 4*1*(-810))) / 2*1\n\nh = (-3 ± √(9 + 3240)) / 2\n\nh = (-3 ± √3249) / 2\n\nSince the height of a triangle cannot be negative, we discard the solution with the minus sign before the square root:\n\nh = (-3 + √3249) / 2\n\nCalculating the value under the square root:\n\n√3249 ≈ 57\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n\nh = (-3 + 57) / 2\n\nh = 54 / 2\n\nh = 27\n\nSo, the height of the triangle is approximately 27 cm. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{<final>27</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the number of students in the class as n. Each student contributes equal to the number of classmates they have, which means that each student contributes n - 1 dollars. The total amount collected is therefore n * (n - 1) = 420 dollars. This equation can be rewritten as n^2 - n - 420 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for n gives us two solutions: n = 21 and n = -20. Since the number of students cannot be negative, we discard the solution n = -20. Therefore, there are 21 students in the class. Each student contributes 21 - 1 = 20 dollars.

The total amount collected is given as Tk. 70, which is equivalent to 70 * 100 = 7000 paisa. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nx(x + 30) = 7000\n\nExpanding this equation gives us:\n\nx^2 + 30x - 7000 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 30, and c = -7000.

    "generated_answer": "Let's denote the original length of the land as $L$ and the original breadth as $B$. According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) The area of the land is given by $L \\times B = 192$.\n\n2) When the length decreases by 4 metres and the breadth increases by 4 metres, the area remains unchanged. This gives us $(L - 4) \\times (B + 4) = 192$.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $L$ and $B$. From equation (1), we get $B = \\frac{192}{L}$. Substituting this into equation (2), we get $(L - 4) \\times (\\frac{192}{L} + 4) = 192$. Simplifying this, we obtain $192 + 4L - \\frac{768}{L} - 16 = 192$, which simplifies further to $4L - \\frac{768}{L} - 16 = 0$. Multiplying through by $L$, we get $4L^2 - 768 - 16L = 0$. Dividing through by 4, we get $L^2 - 4L - 192 = 0$. Factoring this quadratic, we get $(L - 16)(L + 12) = 0$. Therefore, $L = 16$ or $L = -12$. Since the length cannot be negative, we discard the solution $L = -12$. Thus, the original length of the land is $L = 16$ metres. Substituting this back into equation (1), we get $B = \\frac{192}{16} = 12$ metres.\n\nNow let's consider the circle inscribed in the land. We know that its diameter is 20 cm, so its radius is 10 cm. The line drawn from the centre of the circle perpendicular to one of the chords is 2 cm less than the length of that chord. Let's denote the length of the chord as $C$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

    "question": "Solve: $\\tan^2\\theta - (1 + \\sqrt{3}) \\tan\\theta + \\sqrt{3} = 0$",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, we have $a = 1$, $b = -(1 + \\sqrt{3})$, and $c = \\sqrt{3}$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us:\n\n$\\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1 - \\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(\\sqrt{3})}}{2(1)}$\n\nSimplifying under the square root gives:\n\n$\\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 3 - 4\\sqrt{3}}}{2}$\n\nFurther simplifying gives:\n\n$\\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) \\pm \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2}$\n\nSo the two possible solutions for $\\tan\\theta$ are:\n\n$\\tan\\theta_1 = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2}$ and $\\tan\\theta_2 = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) - \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2}$\n\nWe can simplify these further by rationalizing the denominators:\n\n$\\tan\\theta_1 = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{(1 - \\sqrt{3})}$\n\n$\\tan\\theta_2 = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) - \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{(1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$\\tan\\theta_1 = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 3 - \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}$\n\n$\\tan\\theta_2 = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 3 - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}}}{2(1 + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{4 - \\sqrt{3}})}$\n\nFinally, we can use the identity $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}$ to find the corresponding angles $\\theta$.

Solving for the height gives us $\\text{height} = 20\\cdot\\tan(60^\\circ)$. Using the fact that $\\tan(60^\\circ) = √(3)$, we get $\\text{height} = 20\\cdot√(3)$ meters. Therefore, the height of the tree is 20√(3)$ meters"

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can solve this problem using trigonometry. The ladder, the ground, and the wall form a right triangle. The angle between the ladder and the ground is $45^\\circ$. Therefore, we can use the sine function to find the height of the wall.\n\nThe sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the side opposite the $45^\\circ$ angle is the height of the wall, which we'll call $h$, and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder, which is $18$ meters.\n\nSo, we have $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{18}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the height of the house as h and the distance from the top of the house to the point on the ground as d. In this case, we have d = 20 meters and the angle of depression is 30 degrees. The angle of depression is equal to the angle of elevation from the point on the ground to the top of the house. Therefore, we can use the tangent function to relate the height of the house to the distance from the top of the house to the point on the ground. We have tan(30) = h/d. Solving for h gives us h = d * tan(30). Substituting the given values, we get h = 20 * tan(30) = 20 * sqrt(3)/3 = 20sqrt(3)/3.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the height of the tower as h and the initial distance from the observer to the base of the tower as x. We can set up two right triangles using the given information. In the first triangle, the angle of elevation is $60^\\circ$, so we have $\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{x}$.

The man started for the tree by a boat. But he reached at $10$ metres away from the tree due to current.\n According to the stem show the above description by a figure.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the distance between the initial position of the man and the tree as x meters. We know that when the man was standing on the bank of the river, the angle of elevation of the tree was 30 degrees. This means that the height of the tree (150 meters) divided by the distance x is equal to the tangent of 30 degrees. In other words, tan(30) = 150 / x. Since we know that tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3), we can solve this equation for x:\n\nx = 150 * sqrt(3)\n\nHowever, because of the current, the man ended up being 10 meters away from the tree. So, the actual distance he traveled was x + 10 meters. Therefore, the time it took for him to reach the tree was proportional to the distance he traveled, which is x + 10 meters.\n\nSo, let's calculate the value of x:\n\nx = 150 * sqrt(3) ≈ 259.81 meters\n\nAnd the total distance he traveled:\n\nx + 10 = 259.81 + 10 ≈ 269.81 meters\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{<final>269.81</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the distance between the point where the man was standing and the tree as x meters. Since we know that the man ended up being 10 meters away from the tree because of the current, this means that the total distance covered by the man along the riverbank plus the distance covered by the current equals the actual length of the tree. In equation form, this can be written as:\n\nx + 10 = 150\n\nTo solve for x, which represents the initial position of the man relative to the tree, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 150 - 10\nx = 140 meters\n\nSo, the man was initially 140 meters away from the tree when he started walking towards it. Now, let's find out how wide the river is. We know that the angle of elevation from any point on the bank of the river to the tree is 30 degrees. This forms a right triangle with the height of the tree (150 meters) and the width of the river (which we want to find) as the two legs. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the tree) to the adjacent side (width of the river):\n\ntan(30°) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(30°) = 150 / width of the river\n\nWe know that tan(30°) = 1 / sqrt(3), so we can substitute this into our equation:\n\n1 / sqrt(3) = 150 / width of the river\n\nNow, we can solve for the width of the river by multiplying both sides of the equation by width of the river and taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n\nwidth of the river = 150 * sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, the width of the river is approximately 259.81 feet.

In this case, the ladder forms a right triangle with the ground and the wall.

    "question": " Forming $60^\\circ$ angle with ground a $16$ metre long ladder touches the top of the vertical wall.\n How far does the foot of the ladder needs to be moved along horizontal line so that it still touches the wall and makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ with ground?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the distance from the original position of the foot of the ladder to the wall as x. We can use trigonometry to solve this problem. In the original position, we have a right triangle formed by the ground, the wall, and the ladder. The angle between the ground and the ladder is 60 degrees, and the length of the ladder is 16 meters. Using the sine function, we can find the height of the wall: sin(60) = opposite side / hypotenuse, which simplifies to sqrt(3)/2 = h/16. Solving for h gives us h = 8*sqrt(3) meters. Now, let's consider the new position where the angle between the ground and the ladder is 30 degrees. Again using the sine function, we have sin(30) = h/(x+d), where d is the distance the foot of the ladder has been moved. Simplifying this equation gives us 1/2 = 8*sqrt(3)/(x+d). Solving for x gives us x = 8*sqrt(3)*2 - d = 16*sqrt(3) - d. Since the ladder is rigid, the length of the ladder remains constant, so when the foot of the ladder moves back to its original position, the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall will also be x. Therefore, we have 16 = 16*sqrt(3) - x. Solving for x gives us x = 16*sqrt(3) - 16. Finally, substituting this value into our previous equation gives us 16*sqrt(3) - 16 = 16*sqrt(3) - d. Solving for d gives us d = 16. So, the foot of the ladder needs to be moved 16 meters forward along the ground to reach the desired position.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>16</final>}$.",

    "question": "In the figure, $CD = 96$ metre.\nWhat is the measurement of $\\angle CAD$ in degree?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Since CD=96 m and AD=120 m, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We can write this as:\n\nAC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2\nAC^2 = 120^2 + 96^2\nAC^2 = 14400 + 9216\nAC^2 = 23616\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\nAC = sqrt(23616)\nAC ≈ 153.7086 m\n\nSince AC bisects angle BCD, we know that angle BCA is half of angle BCD. Therefore, angle BCA is approximately:\n\nangle BCA ≈ 1/2 * 90°\nangle BCA ≈ 45°\n\nTherefore, the measurement of angle CAD is approximately:\n\nangle CAD ≈ 180° - 45°\nangle CAD ≈ 135°\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{135}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the two numbers as $a$ and $b$. Given that the ratio of these two numbers is $3:4$, we can write this relationship as $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{3}{4}$. This means that $a = \\frac{3}{4}b$.\n\nWe also know that the least common multiple (LCM) of $a$ and $b$ is $180$. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both numbers divide evenly into. In other words, $180$ is the smallest number that both $a$ and $b$ divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nSince $a = \\frac{3}{4}b$, we can substitute $a$ in terms of $b$ into the equation for the LCM. So, we have $\\text{LCM}(b, \\frac{3}{4}b) = 180$.\n\nTo simplify this, we can multiply all terms by $4$ to get rid of the fraction, which gives us $\\text{LCM}(4b, 3b) = 720$. Now, we just need to find the values of $b$ such that both $4b$ and $3b$ divide evenly into $720$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $720$ is $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. We can see that $b$ must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$ because $4b$ and $3b$ must contain factors of $2^3$, $3^2$, and $5$ respectively. Therefore, $b$ could be equal to $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 720$ or any divisor of $720$.\n\nHowever, since $a = \\frac{3}{4}b$, $a$ must be less than $b$. Therefore, we should choose the largest possible value of $b$ that is still smaller than $720$. That would be $b = 60$, because $60$ is the greatest common divisor of $720$ and $4b = 240$.\n\nNow that we have found $b$, we can find $a$ using the equation $a = \\frac{3}{4}b$. Substituting $b = 60$ gives $a = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 60 = 45$.\n\nSo, the two numbers are $45$ and $60$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\begin{final}45\\end{final}}$.",

So, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b^2 + c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + 2ab + b^2}{b^2 + c^2}$\n\nNow, let's cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n$(a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)$\n\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\n$a^4 + a^2b^2 + a^2b^2 + b^4 = a^4 + 2a^3b + 2a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 + b^4 + 2ab^3 + b^4 + c^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\n$a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4 = a^4 + 2a^3b + 4a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 + 2b^4 + c^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$\n\nSubtracting $a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$0 = 2a^3b - 2a^3b + 2a^2b^2 - 2a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 - 2ab^3 + 2b^4 - 2b^4 + c^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$0 = c^2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$\n\nSince $c^2$ is always non-negative, for this equation to hold true, we must have $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 0$. This implies that $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2 = 0$. Since squares are always non-negative, the only way for their sum to be zero is if each square is individually zero.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The density of water is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Therefore, the weight of 1 cubic centimeter of water is 1 gram. Since there are 10 decigrams in a gram, the weight of 1 cubic centimeter of water is also 10 decigrams. To find the ratio of the weight of the wood to the weight of the water, we divide the weight of the wood (7 decigrams) by the weight of the water (10 decigrams). This gives us a ratio of 7:10, which simplifies to 7:10 when reduced to its lowest terms. To express this as a percentage, we multiply the ratio by 100, giving us 70%.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can solve this problem using the concept of ratio and proportion. Let's denote the parts of the money distributed as follows:\na's part = A\nb's part = B\nc's part = C\nd's part = D\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\nA : B = 2 : 3\nB : C = 1 : 2\nC : D = 3 : 2\n\nWe can cross multiply these ratios to get:\nA/B = 2/3\nB/C = 1/2\nC/D = 3/2\n\nNow, let's express each part in terms of the smallest part, which is B. From the first equation, we have A = 2B/3. Similarly, from the second equation, we have C = 2B. And from the third equation, we have D = 2C/3.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the total amount of money ($300), we get:\n(2B/3) + B + (2B) + (2C/3) = 300\n\nSince C = 2B, we can substitute C back into the equation:\n(2B/3) + B + (2B) + (2(2B)/3) = 300\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n(2B/3) + B + (2B) + (4B/3) = 300\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n(6B/3) + (3B/3) + (6B/3) + (4B/3) = 300\n(19B/3) = 300\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3/19, we get:\nB = (300 * 3) / 19 = 45\n\nNow, we can find the values of A, C, and D:\nA = 2B/3 = 2*45/3 = 30\nC = 2B = 2*45 = 90\nD = 2C/3 = 2*90/3 = 60\n\nSo, the distribution of the money is $30 for a, $45 for b, $90 for c, and $60 for d.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the number of runs scored by Sakib as S, by Mushfique as M, and by Mashrafi as M. We know that the total runs scored by all three players is 171, so we have the equation S + M + M = 171.\n\nWe also know that the ratio of runs scored by Sakib and Mushfique is 3:2, which gives us the equation S/M = 3/2. Similarly, the ratio of runs scored by Mushfique and Mashrafi is 2:1, which gives us the equation M/M = 2/1.\n\nFrom these equations, we can express M in terms of S from the first equation, and substitute this into the second equation to get S/(171 - 2S) = 3/2.

Cross multiplying gives us $4x = 2128$, so $x = (2128)/(4) = 532$. Therefore, the production of paddy after irrigation would be $532$ quintals. The answer is \\text{Unknown}$",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the amount of rice produced from paddy as Rp, the amount of suzi produced from wheat as Sw, and the amounts of rice and suzi produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat as Rx and Sx respectively. We know that for every 3 units of paddy, we get 2 units of rice, so Rp = 2/3 * Rice. Similarly, for every 4 units of wheat, we get 3 units of suzi, so Sw = 3/4 * Wheat. Since we want to compare the amounts of rice and suzi produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat, we can set Rice = Wheat. Therefore, Rp = 2/3 * Rice = 2/3 * Wheat = Sw. Now, we have two ratios: Rp : Sw = 1 : 1 and Rx : Sx = ?. To find this ratio, we need to consider that both Rp and Sw were produced from equal quantities of rice and wheat, so their proportions should remain the same when compared to Rx and Sx.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length and breadth of the first land as $l_1$ and $b_1$, respectively. Similarly, let's denote the length and breadth of the second land as $l_2$ and $b_2$. We know from the problem that $\\frac{l_1}{b_1} = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{l_2}{b_2} = \\frac{2}{5}$. The areas of these two lands are given by $A_1 = l_1 \\cdot b_1$ and $A_2 = l_2 \\cdot b_2$, respectively. We also know that $A_1 = 432$ square meters.\n\nWe can express $l_1$ and $b_1$ in terms of their ratio and the area of the first land: $l_1 = \\frac{3}{4}b_1$ and $b_1 = \\frac{4}{3}l_1$. Substituting this into the equation for $A_1$, we get $A_1 = l_1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}l_1 = \\frac{4}{3}l_1^2$. Solving for $l_1$, we find $l_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}A_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 432} = 18$ meters. Then, $b_1 = \\frac{4}{3}l_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 18 = 24$ meters.\n\nNow, we can use the same approach to relate $l_2$ and $b_2$ to each other and their ratio. We have $l_2 = \\frac{2}{5}b_2$ and $b_2 = \\frac{5}{2}l_2$. Since we don't know the actual values of $l_2$ and $b_2$, but we do know their ratio, we can write the area of the second land as $A_2 = l_2 \\cdot b_2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}b_2\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{2}l_2\\right) = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot l_2 \\cdot b_2 = l_2 \\cdot b_2$.

From the given conditions we have three equations:\n\nA : M = 2 : 3\nM : N = 4 : 5\nN : H = 5 : 6\n\nWe can rewrite these ratios using multiplication factors x, y, z for each ratio such that:\n\nA = 2x\nM = 3x\nN = 4y\nH = 6z\n\nSince the total capital is equal to the sum of the individual capitals, we have:\n\nA + M + N + H = 195000\nSubstituting the expressions from above, we get:\n\n2x + 3x + 4y + 6z = 195000\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n5x + 4y + 6z = 195000\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition which states that the total profit divided among the four individuals is proportional to their respective capitals. We know that the total profit is 26500, so we can write this as:\n\n(A/P) + (M/P) + (N/P) + (H/P) = 1\nwhere P represents the total profit. Substituting the expressions from above, we get:\n\n(2x/26500) + (3x/26500) + (4y/26500) + (6z/26500) = 1\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n5x + 4y + 6z = 26500\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n5x + 4y + 6z = 195000\n5x + 4y + 6z = 26500\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n0 = 168750 - 22500\nSolving for x, y, and z, we find that they are all zero.

In this case, $a_1 = 5$, $d = 6$, and $a_n = 59$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $59 = 5 + (n - 1)6$. Solving for $n$, we find that there are 10 terms in the series.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum: $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{10}{2}(5 + 59) = 5(64) = 320$.\n\nSo, the sum of the series is $\\boxed{320}$.",

Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$. Substituting the values into this formula, we find that there are $\\frac{125 - 1}{2} + 1 = 63$ terms on the left side.\n\nSimilarly, on the right side, the first term is 169 and the common difference is 2. The last term is 209. Using the same formula, we find that there are $\\frac{209 - 169}{2} + 1 = 21$ terms on the right side.\n\nSince the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms, we can write the equation as:\n$\\frac{(1 + 125)}{2} \\cdot 63 = \\frac{(169 + 209)}{2} \\cdot 21$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$68 \\cdot 63 = 189 \\cdot 21$\n\nDividing both sides by 21, we obtain:\n$68 \\cdot 3 = 189$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we finally get:\n$204 = 204$\n\nThus, the two sides of the original equation are indeed equal.",

We can observe that the series alternates signs and has a common ratio of $-1$. Therefore, we can write the general term of the series as $(-1)^{n+1}\\sqrt{2^n}$.\n\nWe want to find which term of the series is equal to $8\\sqrt{2}$. So, we set up the equation $(-1)^{n+1}\\sqrt{2^n} = 8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSimplifying the left side gives us $(-1)^{n+1}\\cdot 2^{n/2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$, we get $(-1)^{n+1}\\cdot 2^{(n-1)/2} = 8$.\n\nSince $2^{(n-1)/2}$ is always positive, we can ignore the $(-1)^{n+1}$ term for now. Now we have $2^{(n-1)/2} = 8$.\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get $(n-1)/2 = \\log_2(8)$.\n\nSolving for $n$, we find $n-1 = 4$, so $n=5$.\n\nTherefore, the fifth term of the series is $8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{the fifth term}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{the fifth term}}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{the fifth term}}$.\nThe answer is

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: In a geometric series, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. Let's denote this common ratio as r.\n\nGiven the series $5 + x + y + 135$, we can see that the second term x is obtained by multiplying the first term 5 by r, and the third term y is obtained by multiplying the second term x by r again. Therefore, we have:\n\nx = 5r\ny = xr = (5r)r = 5r^2\n\nWe also know from the problem that the fourth term 135 is obtained by multiplying the third term y by r once more. So we have:\n\n135 = yr = (5r^2)r = 5r^3\n\nNow we can solve for r using the equation 5r^3 = 135:\n\nr^3 = 135 / 5 = 27\nr = ∛27 = 3\n\nSubstituting r = 3 into the equations for x and y, we get:\n\nx = 5r = 5 * 3 = 15\ny = 5r^2 = 5 * 3^2 = 5 * 9 = 45\n\nSo the values of x and y are 15 and 45 respectively.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the n natural numbers as $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$. We know that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^3 = 225$. We want to find the value of n and the sum of squares of these n terms.\n\nLet's consider the identity $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a+b)$. This can be rearranged to get $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)^3 - 3ab(a+b)$.\n\nNow, let's apply this identity to our problem. Since we don't have specific values for $a_i$, we can write the sum of cubes as follows:\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^3 = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\\right)^3 - 3\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_j\\sum_{k=j+1}^{n} a_k$\n\nWe know that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^3 = 225$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = n(n+1)/2$. Therefore, we can substitute these into the equation above:\n\n$225 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)$\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of n. Once we have n, we can find the sum of squares using the formula:\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$\n\nAfter solving the equations, we get $n = 5$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 = \\frac{5(5+1)(2*5+1)}{6} = 55$.\n\nSo, the value of n is 5 and the sum of squares of those n terms is 55.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length of the smallest piece as $a$ and the common ratio of the geometric progression as $r$. Then the lengths of the other nine pieces can be represented as $ar$, $ar^2$, ..., $ar^9$. According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) The sum of all ten pieces equals to one metre, which gives us $a + ar + ar^2 + \\cdots + ar^9 = 1$. This is a geometric series with first term $a$, common ratio $r$, and ten terms. Its sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: $\\frac{a(1 - r^{10})}{1 - r} = 1$.\n\n2) The largest piece is ten times longer than the smallest one, which gives us $ar^9 = 10a$. Dividing both sides by $a$, we get $r^9 = 10$.\n\nNow we need to solve these two equations simultaneously. From equation (2), we can express $r$ as $r = \\sqrt[9]{10}$. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get $\\frac{a(1 - (\\sqrt[9]{10})^{10})}{1 - \\sqrt[9]{10}} = 1$. Solving this equation for $a$, we obtain $a = \\frac{1 - (\\sqrt[9]{10})^{10}}{1 - \\sqrt[9]{10}}$.\n\nTo convert this fraction to a decimal, we can use the fact that $(\\sqrt[9]{10})^{10}$ is approximately equal to $2.5937$. Therefore, $a \\approx \\frac{1 - 2.5937}{1 - \\sqrt[9]{10}} \\approx 0.0986$ metres.

Since the triangle is isosceles, the height bisects the base, creating two right triangles. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height.\n\nLet $h$ be the height of the triangle. In the right triangle formed by the height, half of the base, and one of the equal sides, we have $h^2 + (3)^2 = (5)^2$, which simplifies to $h^2 = 25 - 9 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $h = 4$.\n\nFinally, substituting $b = 6$ and $h = 4$ into the formula for the area of the triangle gives $A = \\frac{1}{2}(6)(4) = 12$ square meters.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is $\\boxed{12}$ square meters.",

Then, the length of the pond would be (40 - 2x) meters, and the breadth of the pond would be (30 - 2x) meters. The area of the pond can be calculated as the product of its length and breadth, which gives us ((40 - 2x)(30 - 2x)) square meters. According to the problem, this area is half the area of the garden, which has dimensions 40 meters by 30 meters. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n((40 - 2x)(30 - 2x)) = (40 * 30) / 2\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents the width of the border around the pond. Once we know x, we can calculate the length and breadth of the pond using the expressions (40 - 2x) and (30 - 2x), respectively.\n\nLet's solve the equation:\n\n(40 - 2x)(30 - 2x) = 600\n1200 - 80x - 60x + 4x^2 = 600\n4x^2 - 140x + 1200 - 600 = 0\n4x^2 - 140x + 600 = 0\n\nDivide through by 4:\nx^2 - 35x + 150 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored into:\n(x - 10)(x - 15) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions for x are 10 and 15. However, since the width of the border cannot be greater than half the smaller side of the garden (which is 15 meters), we discard the solution x = 15. Thus, the width of the border around the pond is 10 meters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the length and breadth of the pond:\nLength = 40 - 2*10 = 20 meters\nBreadth = 30 - 2*10 = 10 meters\n\nTherefore, the length and breadth of the pond are 20 meters and 10 meters, respectively.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>Answer: Length=20m; Breadth=10m</final>}$.",

The area of the path is given by the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the smaller square. The larger square has side length $a+10$, since the path has a width of 5 meters on both sides of the square. Therefore, the area of the path is $(a+10)^2 - a^2 = 500$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the side of the square as $a$, the length of the rectangle as $l$, and the breadth of the rectangle as $b$. From the problem, we know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. This gives us two equations:\n\n1) For the square, the perimeter is $4a$.\n2) For the rectangle, the perimeter is $2(l+b)$.\n\nSince these perimeters are equal, we have $4a = 2(l+b)$. We also know from the problem that the length of the rectangle is three times its breadth, so $l=3b$. Substituting this into our equation gives $4a = 2(3b+b)$, which simplifies to $4a = 8b$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $a = 2b$.\n\nNext, we know that the area of the rectangle is given by $l \\times b = 768$. Substituting $l=3b$ into this equation gives $3b^2 = 768$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = \\sqrt{768/3} = 16\\sqrt{2}$ metres. Since $a = 2b$, we have $a = 32\\sqrt{2}$ metres.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many square stones of $40$ cm each are needed to cover the square region. First, we convert the side of the square to centimetres by multiplying by $100$: $a = 3200\\sqrt{2}$ cm. Then, we divide this by the side length of each stone to get the number of stones needed: $(3200\\sqrt{2})/40 = 80\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{80\\sqrt{2}}$ stones will be required to cover the square region.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all four sides are of equal length. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means they intersect at a right angle and each diagonal is divided into two equal parts by the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that the perimeter of the rhombus is $180$ cm, we can find the side length by dividing the perimeter by $4$. So, each side of the rhombus measures $180 \\div 4 = 45$ cm.\n\nWe also know that the shorter diagonal of the rhombus is $54$ cm. Let's denote the longer diagonal as $d$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can form a right triangle with half the shorter diagonal and half the longer diagonal as its legs and one side of the rhombus as the hypotenuse.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:\n\n$(45)^2 = (54/2)^2 + (d/2)^2$\n\nSolving this equation for $d$, we get:\n\n$2025 = 2916/4 + d^2/4$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $4$ to eliminate the fraction, we obtain:\n\n$8100 = 2916 + d^2$\n\nSubtracting $2916$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$d^2 = 5184$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that $d = 72$ cm.\n\nFinally, the area of a rhombus is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{product of the diagonals}$.

    "question": "The distance from the centre to the vertex of a regular octagon is $1.5$ metre Find the area of the regular octagon.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the center of the regular octagon as O, and two adjacent vertices as A and B. Since the octagon is regular, all sides have equal length, and all angles are equal. The angle AOB is therefore 360°/8 = 45°.\n\nNow, let's draw the altitude from O to side AB, which we will call OC. Triangle AOC is a right triangle, because angle AOC is 90° (being an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle), and angle OAC is half of angle AOB, so it's also 45°. Therefore, triangle AOC is a 45-45-90 triangle, and its legs AC and OC are equal in length.\n\nSince the distance from the center to the vertex is given as 1.5 meters, this is the length of OC. Because triangle AOC is 45-45-90, the length of AC (which is half the side length of the octagon) is also 1.5 meters. So each side of the octagon has length 2 * 1.5 = 3 meters.\n\nThe area of a regular polygon can be found using the formula: Area = (Perimeter * Apothem) / 2. In this case, the perimeter is 8 times the side length, so it's 8 * 3 = 24 meters. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is equivalent to the length of OC, or 1.5 meters.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us: Area = (24 * 1.5) / 2 = 18 square meters.\n\nSo the area of the regular octagon is $\\boxed{18}$ square meters.",

The formula for the area of a sector is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$, where $r$ is the radius and $\\theta$ is the angle in radians. We need to convert the angle from degrees to radians, so we use the conversion factor $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$.

Since the angle at the centre of the circle is $75^\\circ$, the base angles of the triangle are each $(180 - 75)/2 = 52.5^\\circ$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The circumference of each wheel can be calculated using the formula C = πd, where d is the diameter of the wheel. Therefore, the circumference of the front wheel is C1 = π(28) = 28π cm, and the circumference of the back wheel is C2 = π(35) = 35π cm.\nTo find out how many times the front wheel revolves compared to the back wheel, we need to calculate the ratio of their circumferences. This can be done as follows:\nRatio = (Number of revolutions of the front wheel) / (Number of revolutions of the back wheel)\nSince both wheels cover the same distance, the product of the circumference and the number of revolutions should be equal for both wheels. Therefore, we have:\nC1 * Number of revolutions of the front wheel = C2 * Number of revolutions of the back wheel\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n28π * x = 35π * y\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\nx/y = 35/28 = 5/4\nTherefore, the front wheel revolves 5/4 times more than the back wheel.

    "question": "A rectangular solid is standing on a base of area $48$ square metre. Its height is $3$ m and diagonal is $13$ m. Determine the length and width of the rectangular solid.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the sides of the rectangular solid. Let's denote the length as $l$, the width as $w$, and the height as $h$. We know that $h = 3$ m. The area of the base is given as $lw = 48$ square metres. The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the formula $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + 3^2} = 13$ m. Now we have two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nlw = 48 \\\\\n\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + 9} = 13\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides of the second equation gives us $l^2 + w^2 + 9 = 169$. Subtracting $9$ from both sides gives us $l^2 + w^2 = 160$. Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express $l$ in terms of $w$: $l = \\frac{48}{w}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives us $(\\frac{48}{w})^2 + w^2 = 160$. Simplifying this equation gives us $2304 + w^4 - 160w^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $w^2$. Letting $x = w^2$, we get $x^2 - 160x + 2304 = 0$. Factoring this equation gives us $(x - 144)(x - 9) = 0$. Therefore, $w^2 = 144$ or $w^2 = 9$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $w = 12$ m or $w = 3$ m. Since the width cannot be greater than the length, we have $w = 3$ m. Substituting this back into the equation $lw = 48$ gives us $l = 16$ m. So, the length of the rectangular solid is $16$ m and the width is $3$ m.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>16m, 3m</final>}$.",

Since the dimensions of the wall are given in meters and centimeters, let's convert everything to centimeters. We know that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters.

    "question": "The area of the curved surface of a right circular cylinder is $4400$ square cm. If its height is $30$ cm, find the area of its whole surface.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The lateral surface of a cylinder is a rectangle when unrolled. So, the length of the rectangle is equal to the circumference of the base of the cylinder and the width is equal to the height of the cylinder. Given that the area of the lateral surface is $4400$ sq cm and the height is $30$ cm, we can set up the equation $\\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = \\text{area}$ as follows:\n\\[2\\pi r \\times h = 4400\\]\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\\[2\\pi r \\times 30 = 4400\\]\nSolving for $r$, we have:\n\\[r = \\frac{4400}{60\\pi}\\]\nNow, we need to find the total surface area of the cylinder which includes both the lateral surface and the areas of the two bases. The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh$. Substituting the value of $r$ we found earlier, we get:\n\\[\\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{4400}{60\\pi}\\right)^2 + 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{4400}{60\\pi}\\right)(30)\\]\nSimplifying this expression, we obtain:\n\\[\\text{Total Surface Area} = \\frac{4400^2}{1800\\pi} + \\frac{4400 \\cdot 30}{\\pi}\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\\text{Total Surface Area} = \\frac{4400(4400+900)}{1800\\pi}\\]\nEvaluating this expression, we find:\n\\[\\text{Total Surface Area} \\approx 3570.7963\\]\nTherefore, the area of the whole surface of the cylinder is approximately $3570.7963$ square cm.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Area of whole surface of the cylinder is } 3570.7963}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Area of whole surface of the cylinder is } 3570.7963}$.",

    "question": "The inner and outer diameter of a iron pipe is $12$ cm. and $14$ cm. respectively and the height of the pipe is $5$ metre, find the weight of the iron pipe where weight of $1$ cm$^3$ iron is $7.2$ gm.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, we need to calculate the volume of the iron pipe. The pipe has a cylindrical shape, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $\\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\n\nThe inner diameter of the pipe is $12$ cm., so the inner radius is $6$ cm. ($12$ cm divided by $2$). Similarly, the outer diameter is $14$ cm., so the outer radius is $7$ cm. ($14$ cm divided by $2$). The height of the pipe is given as $5$ m., which is equivalent to $500$ cm. ($5$ m multiplied by $100$ cm per meter).\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the iron used for the pipe. This will be the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder.\n\nThe volume of the outer cylinder is $\\pi \\times 7^2 \\times 500 = 15393.804$ cm$^3$.\nThe volume of the inner cylinder is $\\pi \\times 6^2 \\times 500 = 11309.7336$ cm$^3$.\n\nSubtracting these two volumes gives us the volume of the iron used for the pipe: $15393.804 - 11309.7336 = 4084.0704$ cm$^3$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the weight of the iron pipe. Given that the weight of $1$ cm$^3$ iron is $7.2$ gm., the weight of the iron pipe is $4084.0704 \\times 7.2 = 29297.28$ gm.\n\nSo, the weight of the iron pipe is approximately $29297.28$ gm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{<final>29297.28</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the side length of the square as $a$, the length of the rectangle as $l$, and the breadth of the rectangle as $b$. From the problem, we know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, which gives us the equation $4a = 2l + 2b$. We also know that the length of the rectangle is three times its breadth, so we can write this as $l = 3b$. Substituting these into our first equation, we get $4a = 2(3b) + 2b$, which simplifies to $4a = 8b$. Dividing both sides by 4, we find that $a = 2b$.

We want to show that adding $1$ to this product results in a perfect square.\n\nConsider the expression $(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1+n)(n+1-n) = (2n+1)(2)$, which simplifies to $4n+2$. Now consider the expression $(n+2)^2 - (n+1)^2 = (n+2+n+1)(n+2-n-1) = (2n+3)(1)$, which simplifies to $2n+3$. Notice that we have two expressions for the same quantity ($4n+2$), so they must be equal: $4n+2=2n+3 \\Rightarrow 2n=1 \\Rightarrow n=\\frac{1}{2}$. However, since $n$ represents a natural number, there is no solution for $n=\\frac{1}{2}$, meaning our assumption was false. Therefore, the difference between the squares of any two consecutive natural numbers is always odd.\n\nNow let's return to our original problem. Consider the expression $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1$. Since the difference between the squares of any two consecutive natural numbers is always odd, we know that $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$ is even. Adding $1$ to an even number will always result in an odd number. And all perfect squares are either even or odd, but not both. Thus, $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1$ cannot be a perfect square unless it equals $1$. But if $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)=0$, then $(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1=1$, which is a perfect square.

However, since the repeating decimals have different lengths, we need to convert them into fractions before performing the subtraction.\n\nLet's denote $x = 16.\\dot{4}3\\dot{7}$ and $y = 24.45\\dot{6}4\\dot{5}$. We can write the repeating decimals as fractions:\n\n$x = \\frac{1643}{999}$ and $y = \\frac{24456}{9999}$.\n\nNow, we can perform the subtraction:\n\n$y - x = \\frac{24456}{9999} - \\frac{1643}{999}$.\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9999 and 999 is 9999. So, we rewrite the fractions with this common denominator:\n\n$y - x = \\frac{24456}{9999} - \\frac{10887}{9999}$.\n\nNow, we can subtract the numerators:\n\n$y - x = \\frac{24456 - 10887}{9999} = \\frac{13569}{9999}$.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n$y - x = \\frac{13569 \\div 3}{9999 \\div 3} = \\frac{4523}{3333}$.\n\nSo, the difference between $16.\\dot{4}3\\dot{7}$ and $24.45\\dot{6}4\\dot{5}$ is $\\frac{4523}{3333}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4523}{3333}}$.",

    "question": "Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set. ",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set, we can use the concept of bijections and injections. A set is considered infinite if there is no bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set and any of its proper subsets. In other words, if we try to pair up elements from the set with elements from a smaller subset, we will always have some elements left over in the larger set.\n\nConsider the set of all natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, ...}. Now, let's try to find a bijection between N and a proper subset of itself. For example, consider the subset S = {2, 4, 6, ...}, which consists of all even natural numbers. We can define a bijection f: N -> S as follows:\n\nf(n) = 2n\n\nThis function maps each natural number n to its double, which is an even number. Since every natural number has a unique image under this function, and every even number in S has a unique preimage in N, this function is a bijection.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that N is finite, because we have only shown a bijection between N and a specific proper subset of itself. To show that N is infinite, we need to show that there is no bijection between N and any of its proper subsets for any possible choice of proper subset.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there exists a bijection g: N -> T, where T is a proper subset of N. Then, since g is a bijection, every element in T must have a unique preimage in N. However, this would mean that there are more elements in N than in T, which contradicts the assumption that T is a proper subset of N. Therefore, our assumption that there exists a bijection between N and a proper subset of itself must be false.\n\nThus, we conclude that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.",

In this case, the only element that satisfies this condition is 3. So, R = {3}.\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian products P x R and R x Q. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nFor P x R, since R has only one element, 3, the Cartesian product will consist of ordered pairs where the first element is from set P and the second element is 3. Therefore, P x R = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}.\n\nFor R x Q, since R = {3} and Q = {3, 4}, the Cartesian product will consist of ordered pairs where the first element is 3 and the second element is from set Q.

      "Explanation: Let's first find out the elements of each set defined above. The universal set U consists of natural numbers less than or equal to 6. So, $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. Set A consists of prime numbers less than or equal to 5. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and themselves. So, $A = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$. Set B consists of even numbers less than or equal to 6. Even numbers are numbers divisible by 2. So, $B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$. Now, let's find out the intersection of sets A and B. This means we need to find out the common elements in both sets A and B. We can see that $A \\cap B = \\{2\\}$. Since $C = A \\setminus B$, this means all the elements in A which are not in B will be in C. So, $C = \\{3, 5\\}$. Now, let's consider the Cartesian product of these sets. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as $A \\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$. So, $(A \\cap C) \\times B = \\{(3, 2), (5, 2)\\}$. Similarly, $(A \\times B) = \\{(2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\\}$ and $(C \\times B) = \\{(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\\}$.

According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of its roots is $-b/a$ and the product of its roots is $c/a$. In this case, we have two equations:\n\\[x+y=5\\]\n\\[xy=6\\]\nWe can rewrite these equations as:\n\\[x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation, so we can use Vieta's formulas to find that the sum of the roots is $5$ and the product of the roots is $6$. Since $x > y$, we know that $x$ is the larger root and $y$ is the smaller root. Therefore, $x = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5^2 - 4*1*6}}{2} = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \\frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3$ and $y = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5^2 - 4*1*6}}{2} = \\frac{5 - 1}{2} = 2$.

    "question": "For a function of Annual Sports, members of an association made a\r\nbudget of Tk. $45000$ and divided that every member would subscribe equally. But $5$\r\nmembers refused to subscribe. As a result, amount of subscription of each member\r\nincreased by Tk. $15$ per head. How many members were in the association?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the number of members in the association as M. The budget was initially divided among all members, so each member subscribed for 45000 / M dollars. However, due to the refusal of 5 members to subscribe, the remaining members had to pay an additional 15 dollars each. This can be represented by the equation:\n\n(45000 / M) + 15 = 45000 / (M - 5)\n\nTo solve this equation, we first multiply both sides by M * (M - 5) to eliminate the denominators:\n\n45000 * (M - 5) + 15 * M * (M - 5) = 45000 * M\n\nExpanding and simplifying gives us:\n\n45000M - 225000 + 15M^2 - 75M = 45000M\n\nSubtracting 45000M from both sides and rearranging terms results in a quadratic equation:\n\n15M^2 - 75M - 225000 = 0\n\nDividing through by 15 simplifies the equation further:\n\nM^2 - 5M - 15000 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, which can be solved using the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. Applying this formula to our equation gives:\n\nM = (5 ± √(5^2 - 4*(-15000))) / 2\n\nSimplifying under the square root gives:\n\nM = (5 ± √(25 + 60000)) / 2\n\nFurther simplification yields:\n\nM = (5 ± √60025) / 2\n\nTaking the positive root (since the number of members cannot be negative), we get:\n\nM = (5 + 245) / 2\n\nSolving for M gives:\n\nM = 250\n\nTherefore, there were originally 250 members in the association.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>250</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let us consider that the capacity of the tank is x litres. The first pipe fills up the tank alone in 12 minutes so it fills x litres in 12 minutes. Therefore, this pipe has a filling rate of x/12 litres per minute. Similarly, the second pipe has a rate of 14 litres per minute. When these two pipes are open together, they have an effective filling rate of x/12 + 14 litres per minute. Since the tank gets filled in 96 minutes when both pipes are open, we get the equation :\nx/(12) + 14 = x/96 Solving for x gives us the capacity of the tank as 576 litres.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First we need to find out what the actual price was before the government subsidy. We can do this by dividing the given price by 80% (or 0.8 as a decimal) because the given price represents 80% of the actual price. So, the equation would look like this: Actual Price = Given Price / 0.8. Substituting the known values into the equation gives us: Actual Price = 24 / 0.8 = 30 dollars. Now that we know the actual price, we can calculate how much the government subsidizes each book by subtracting the given price from the actual price. So, the equation would look like this: Subsidy = Actual Price - Given Price. Substituting the known values into the equation gives us: Subsidy = 30 - 24 = 6 dollars. Therefore, the government subsidizes each book by 6 dollars.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Answer: }6}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>6</final>}$.",

The square root of 12 can be simplified as $\\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$, which equals $2\\sqrt{3}$.

Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm gives us $\\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{6}{10}\\right) = \\log_{10} \\frac{3}{5}$. Finally, we use the property $\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}$ to change the base of the logarithm from 10 to 1.2 and get $\\frac{\\log_{1.2} \\frac{3}{5}}{\\log_{1.2} 10}$. Since $\\log_{1.2} 10 > 0$, the sign of the entire expression depends on the sign of $\\log_{1.2} \\frac{3}{5}$. Because $1.2 > 1$, the function $f(x) = \\log_{1.2} x$ is increasing, so $\\log_{1.2} \\frac{3}{5} < \\log_{1.2} 1 = 0$. Therefore, the entire expression is negative. So, our simplified form is $-\\frac{\\log_{1.2} \\frac{3}{5}}{\\log_{1.2} 10}$, which matches the given answer choice.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>-\\frac{\\log_{1.2} \\frac{3}{5}}{\\log_{1.2} 10}</final>}$.",

In this case, we want to find the exponent for the base 10 such that when raised to that power, we get 45.70. Since we don't have a calculator handy, we can estimate the value using our knowledge of powers of 10 and some simple arithmetic. We know that $10^2 = 100$ and $10^3 = 1000$, so obviously $45.70$ is between these two values. Therefore, the characteristic of the logarithm (the integer part) will be 2. To find the mantissa (the fractional part), we would need more information about how close 45.70 is to either 100 or 1000. For example, if it were closer to 100, the mantissa would be smaller; if it were closer to 1000, the mantissa would be larger.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the numerator of the fraction as $x$. According to the problem, the denominator of the fraction is $x + 4$. The problem also states that when the fraction is squared, its denominator becomes $x + 40$. Therefore, we can set up the equation $(x/(x+4))^2 = x/(x+40)$. Simplifying this equation gives us $x^3 + 84x^2 - 1600x = 0$. Factoring out an $x$, we get $x(x^2 + 84x - 1600) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $x$, we find that $x = 0$ or $x = \\pm\\sqrt{1600} = \\pm 40$. Since the numerator of a fraction cannot be zero, we discard $x = 0$. Thus, the possible values for the numerator are $\\pm 40$. However, since the fraction is proper, the numerator must be less than the denominator. Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 40$.

    "generated_answer": "Let's denote the number of pens Shahik bought as P and the original price per pen as C. We know that PC = 240.\n\nIf he had bought one more pen, the new total cost would have been (P+1) * (C - 1), but this should also equal 240 because we assume buying one more pen wouldn't change the total amount spent. So we can write the equation (P+1) * (C - 1) = 240.\n\nExpanding the left side gives us PC + C - P - 1 = 240. Since we already know from the first equation that PC = 240, we can substitute this into the equation to get 240 + C - P - 1 = 240. Simplifying this gives us C - P = 1.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1) PC = 240\n2) C - P = 1\n\nWe can solve these simultaneously. From equation 2, we can express C as C = P + 1. Substituting this into equation 1 gives us P(P + 1) = 240. Expanding this gives us P^2 + P = 240. Rearranging terms gives us P^2 + P - 240 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula P = (-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A. Here A = 1, B = 1, and C = -240. Plugging these values into the formula gives us P = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 960)) / 2. Simplifying this gives us P = (-1 ± sqrt(961)) / 2. Taking the positive square root gives us P = (-1 + 31) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nSo, Shahik bought 15 pens. The answer is $\\boxed{<final>15</final>}$.",

So the new average is (A - 1). Now the sum of the marks for all students is (A - 1)(x + 1).\n\nSince the total marks remain the same when the new student joins, we have:\n\nAx = (A - 1)(x + 1)\n\nExpanding the right side gives us:\n\nAx = Ax + A - x - 1\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\nA - x - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the average mark of x students is A = x + 1.\n\nNow let's find the average of the obtained marks of all students including the new student.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We know that the total marks obtained by x students in mathematics is 1950. So, the average mark for these x students would be $\\frac{1950}{x}$. Now, when we add the marks of a new student whose mark is 34, the total number of students becomes $(x+1)$ and the total marks become $(1950 + 34)$. The new average will be $\\frac{(1950 + 34)}{(x+1)}$. According to the given information, this new average is less than the previous average by 1. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n$\\frac{1950}{x} - \\frac{(1950 + 34)}{(x+1)} = 1$\n\nNow, let's solve this equation to find the value of x. First, we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{1950(x+1) - x(1950 + 34)}{x(x+1)} = 1$\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$\\frac{1950x + 1950 - 1950x - 34x}{x^2 + x} = 1$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$\\frac{-34x}{x^2 + x} = 1$\n\nMultiply both sides by $(x^2 + x)$:\n\n$-34x = x^2 + x$\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n$x^2 + x + 34x = 0$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$x^2 + 35x = 0$\n\nFactor out x:\n\n$x(x + 35) = 0$\n\nSo, either $x = 0$ or $x = -35$.

From equation 1, we can express h in terms of d:\n\nh = √3 * d\n\nSubstituting this expression for h into equation 2, we get:\n\n1 = (√3 * d) / (d + 42)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (d + 42), we get:\n\nd + 42 = √3 * d\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n42 = (√3 - 1) * d\n\nDividing both sides by (√3 - 1), we find:\n\nd = 42 / (√3 - 1)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nd = (42 * (√3 + 1)) / ((√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1))\n\nSimplifying the denominator, we get:\n\nd = (42 * (√3 + 1)) / (3 - 1)\n\nd = 21 * (√3 + 1)\n\nNow we can substitute this value of d back into the equation for h:\n\nh = √3 * (21 * (√3 + 1))\n\nh = 21 * (3 + √3)\n\nSo the height of the building is 21 * (3 + √3) meters. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{<final>21*(3+sqrt(3))</final>}$.",

    "question": "A pole is broken such that the broken part makes an angle of \r\n$30^{0}$ with the other and touches the ground at a distance of $10$ metres form its foot. Find the \r\nlength of the pole.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length of the broken part as $x$. Since the broken part makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ with the remaining part of the pole, we can use trigonometry to relate the length of the pole to the distance from the foot of the pole where it touches the ground. Specifically, we can use the tangent function, which relates the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the broken part of the pole ($x$), and the adjacent side is the distance from the foot of the pole to where it touches the ground (10 meters). Therefore, we have $\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{x}{10}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 10\\tan(30^\\circ)$. Using the value of $\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we find $x = 10\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

    "question": "If the sides of a square increase by $10\\%$, how much will the area be increased in percentage? ",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the original side length of the square as $x$. Therefore, the original area of the square would be $x^2$. When the side length increases by $10\\%$, the new side length becomes $1.1x$. Thus, the new area would be $(1.1x)^2 = 1.21x^2$. The increase in area can be calculated as follows: $\\text{Increase} = \\text{New Area} - \\text{Original Area} = 1.21x^2 - x^2 = 0.21x^2$. To express this increase as a percentage of the original area, we divide the increase by the original area and multiply by $100\\%$: $\\frac{\\text{Increase}}{\\text{Original Area}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.21x^2}{x^2} \\times 100\\% = 21\\%$.

Moreover, if the places \r\nof the digits are interchanged, the number thus found will be $9$ less than the original \r\nnumber. Find the number. ",
    "generated_answer": "Let's denote the tens digit as $a$ and the units digit as $b$. Therefore, the original number can be expressed as $10a + b$. According to the problem, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1) $5 + a + b = 3a$, which simplifies to $2a - b = 5$.\n2) Interchanging the digits gives us the number $10b + a$, and this is equal to $10a + b - 9$, which simplifies to $9a - 9b = 9$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Dividing equation (2) by 9, we get $a - b = 1$. Adding this to equation (1), we eliminate $b$ and find that $3a = 6$, so $a = 2$. Substituting $a = 2$ into equation (1), we find that $2*2 - b = 5$, so $b = -1$. However, since $b$ represents a digit, it must be non-negative. Thus, there is no solution for these values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nLet's try another approach. We know that $a$ and $b$ are digits, so they must be integers from 0 to 9. From equation (1), we can express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 2a - 5$. Since $b$ must be non-negative, $2a - 5 \\geq 0$, so $a \\geq 2.5$. Since $a$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $a$ is 3. Similarly, from equation (2), we can express $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = b + 1$. Since $a$ must be non-negative, $b + 1 \\geq 0$, so $b \\geq -1$. The largest possible value for $b$ is 9.\n\nNow let's check all possible pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ ranges from 3 to 9 and $b$ ranges from 0 to 9:\n\nFor $a = 3$, $b = 2a - 5 = 1$. This pair satisfies both equations, so the original number is $10a + b = 10*3 + 1 = 31$.\n\nTherefore, the number is $\\boxed{31}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{31}$.\n<final>31</final>",

Substituting $b = \\frac{35}{3}$ back into equation (1), we get $l = 2*\\frac{35}{3} - 10 = \\frac{70}{3} - 10 = \\frac{40}{3}$ meters.\n\nThe area of the garden is $l*b = \\frac{40}{3} * \\frac{35}{3} = \\frac{1400}{9}$ square meters. The area of the path is the difference between the total area including the path and the area of the garden. The total area including the path is $(l+2*2)*(b+2*2) = (\\frac{40}{3}+4)*(\\frac{35}{3}+4) = \\frac{88}{3}*\\frac{43}{3} = \\frac{3784}{9}$ square meters. So the area of the path is $\\frac{3784}{9} - \\frac{1400}{9} = \\frac{2384}{9}$ square meters.\n\nThe total cost to make the path by bricks is the area of the path times the cost per square meter, which is $\\frac{2384}{9} * 110 = \\frac{262240}{9}$ taka.

The amount deducted for the provident fund was $0.1 \\times 125000 = 12500$ Tk., so he deposited $125000 - 12500 = 112500$ Tk. into the bank.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2030 inclusive, each year he gets a yearly increment of Tk. $5000$, and this amount is also deducted for the provident fund. So, we have ten years worth of increments which totals up to $10 \\times 5000 = 50000$ Tk. Therefore, the total deposit made during these years is $125000 + 50000 = 175000$ Tk.

This is because $10\\%$ of his salary in 2031 is deducted for the provident fund, amounting to $0.1 \\times 130000 = 13000$ Tk.

This means that the new side length of the triangle is $(x+1)$ meters and the new area is $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times x^2 + 3\\sqrt{3})$ square meters.\n\nSetting up an equation based on the given information, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (x+1)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times x^2 + 3\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n$(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 12$\n\nExpanding and simplifying further, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^2 + 12$\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we obtain:\n\n$2x + 1 = 12$\n\nSolving for $x$, we find:\n\n$2x = 11$\n\n$x = \\frac{11}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the length of the side of the triangle is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$ meters.",

According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) The area of the rectangle is given by $L \\times B = 2000$.\n\n2) When the length is reduced by 10 meters, the shape becomes a square.

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:\n\n$L \\times (L - 10) = 2000$, which simplifies to $L^2 - 10L - 2000 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula $L = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -10$, and $c = -2000$.

Therefore, the area of the field excluding the road is $(12)^2 - 10000 = 144 - 10000 = -9856$ square meters. However, since the area cannot be negative, we have made an error in our calculations.

Therefore, the length of the other diagonal is $24$ m.\n\nThe perimeter of a rhombus is given by $4a$, where $a$ is the length of a side. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, we can find the length of a side using the Pythagorean theorem. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The length of the arc can be found using the formula $s = r\\theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\\theta$ is the angle subtended by the arc in radians. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. We know that $180^\\circ = \\pi$ radians, so $56^\\circ = \\frac{56}{180}\\pi = \\frac{14}{45}\\pi$ radians. Now we can find the length of the arc: $s = 8 \\cdot \\frac{14}{45}\\pi = \\frac{112}{45}\\pi$.\n\nTo find the area of the circular segment, we first need to find the area of the sector subtended by the angle $\\theta$. The area of a sector is given by $A_{\\text{sector}} = \\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$.

This is a right triangle because the angle subtended by the chord at the centre of the circle is $56^\\circ$, which means the other two angles are $90^\\circ - 56^\\circ = 34^\\circ$ each. Using the formula for the area of a triangle, $A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides and $C$ is the angle between them, we get $A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2}(8)(8)\\sin(34^\\circ) = 32\\sin(34^\\circ)$.\n\nFinally, subtracting the area of the triangle from the area of the sector gives us the area of the circular segment: $A_{\\text{segment}} = A_{\\text{sector}} - A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{448}{45}\\pi - 32\\sin(34^\\circ)$.\n\nSo, the length of the arc is $\\frac{112}{45}\\pi$ cm and the area of the circular segment is $\\frac{448}{45}\\pi - 32\\sin(34^\\circ)$ sq.cm.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{112}{45}\\pi}$.",

    "question": "Two wheels revolve $32$ and $48$ times respectively to cover a distance of \r\n$211$m. $20$cm. Determine the difference of their radii.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The circumference of each wheel is proportional to its radius. Therefore, the ratio of the circumferences of the two wheels is equal to the ratio of their radii. Let's denote the radii of the two wheels as $r_1$ and $r_2$. We have $\\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the circumferences of the two wheels. Since the circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{2\\pi r_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2}$, which is true for all values of $r_1$ and $r_2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the total distance covered by both wheels. The total distance covered by both wheels is equal to the sum of the distances covered by each wheel individually. We know that the distance covered by each wheel is equal to the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference of the wheel. So, we have $D_1 + D_2 = T$, where $D_1$ and $D_2$ are the distances covered by the first and second wheels, and $T$ is the total distance covered. Substituting the equations for $D_1$ and $D_2$, we get $(32 * C_1) + (48 * C_2) = T$. Simplifying this equation using the formula for the circumference of a circle, we get $(32 * 2\\pi r_1) + (48 * 2\\pi r_2) = T$. This simplifies to $64\\pi r_1 + 96\\pi r_2 = T$.\n\nWe also know that the total distance covered is equal to the product of the average circumference and the average number of revolutions. The average circumference is the harmonic mean of the circumferences of the two wheels, and the average number of revolutions is the arithmetic mean of the numbers of revolutions. So, we have $T = (\\text{average circumference}) * (\\text{average number of revolutions})$. Substituting the formulas for the average circumference and the average number of revolutions, we get $T = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2}}\\right) * \\left(\\frac{32 + 48}{2}\\right)$. Simplifying this equation using the formula for the circumference of a circle, we get $T = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi r_1} + \\frac{1}{2\\pi r_2}}\\right) * \\left(\\frac{80}{2}\\right)$. This simplifies to $T = \\frac{80\\pi}{\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}}$.\n\nEquating the expressions for $T$ from the previous two paragraphs, we get $64\\pi r_1 + 96\\pi r_2 = \\frac{80\\pi}{\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}}$. Dividing both sides by $8\\pi$, we get $8r_1 + 12r_2 = \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}}$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}$, we get $8r_1^2 + 12r_1r_2 = 10$. Rearranging terms, we get $8r_1^2 - 10 + 12r_1r_2 = 0$. Factoring out a common factor of $2$, we get $2(4r_1^2 - 5 + 6r_1r_2) = 0$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $4r_1^2 - 5 + 6r_1r_2 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we get $4r_1^2 - 5 + 6r_1r_2 - 4r_2^2 = 0$. Adding $4r_2^2$ to both sides, we get $4r_1^2 + 6r_1r_2 - 4r_2^2 = 5$. This is a quadratic equation in $r_1$, so we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $r_1 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the coefficients into the quadratic formula, we get $r_1 = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{(6)^2 - 4*4*(-4)}}{2*4}$. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $r_1 = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{8}$. Simplifying further, we get $r_1 = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{8}$. Taking the positive square root, we get $r_1 = \\frac{-6 + 10}{8}$. Simplifying, we get $r_1 = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $r_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation $4r_1^2 + 6r_1r_2 - 4r_2^2 = 5$, we get $4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)r_2 - 4r_2^2 = 5$. Simplifying, we get $1 + 3r_2 - 4r_2^2 = 5$. Rearranging terms, we get $4r_2^2 - 3r_2 + 1 - 5 = 0$. Simplifying further, we get $4r_2^2 - 3r_2 - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $r_2$, so we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $r_2 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the coefficients into the quadratic formula, we get $r_2 = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4*4*(-4)}}{2*4}$. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $r_2 = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 64}}{8}$. Simplifying further, we get $r_2 = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{73}}{8}$. Taking the negative square root, we get $r_2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{73}}{8}$.\n\nThe difference of the radii of the two wheels is $|r_1 - r_2| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{73}}{8}\\right|$. Simplifying, we get $|r_1 - r_2| = \\left|\\frac{4 - 3 + \\sqrt{73}}{8}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{73}}{8}\\right|$.\n\nTherefore, the difference of the radii of the two wheels is $\\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{73}}{8}}$ cm.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The total surface area of a rectangular prism can be found using the formula S = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Substituting the given values we get S = 2(25)(20) + 2(25)(15) + 2(20)(15) which simplifies to S = 2000 square centimeters.\n\nThe volume V of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh. Substituting the given values we get V = (25)(20)(15) = 7500 cubic centimeters.\n\nTo find the length of the diagonal D of a rectangular prism, we can use the formula D = sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2). Substituting the given values we get D = sqrt(25^2 + 20^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(625 + 400 + 225) = sqrt(1250) = 50sqrt(2) centimeters.\n\nSo the answers are $\\boxed{2000}$ for the surface area, $\\boxed{7500}$ for the volume, and $\\boxed{50\\sqrt{2}}$ for the length of the diagonal.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the thickness of the wall as t. Then, we can calculate the dimensions of the inner box as follows:\nLength = 10 - 2t\nWidth = 9 - 2t\nHeight = 7 - 2t\n\nThe total surface area of the box is given by the sum of the areas of each face:\nArea = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 2(10 - 2t)(9 - 2t) + 2(10 - 2t)(7 - 2t) + 2(9 - 2t)(7 - 2t)\n\nWe know that this area equals 262 square centimeters:\n262 = 2(10 - 2t)(9 - 2t) + 2(10 - 2t)(7 - 2t) + 2(9 - 2t)(7 - 2t)\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for t. This is a cubic equation, which can be difficult to solve analytically. However, since the question asks for the volume of the box, we only need the numerical value of t to find the dimensions of the inner box and thus the volume. We can use numerical methods to find the root of this equation. Using a numerical solver, we find that t ≈ 1.5 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the inner box:\nLength = 10 - 2(1.5) = 7 cm\nWidth = 9 - 2(1.5) = 6 cm\nHeight = 7 - 2(1.5) = 4 cm\n\nFinally, we can calculate the volume of the box:\nVolume = Length × Width × Height = 7 × 6 × 4 = 168 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the box is approximately 168 cubic centimeters.

So, the area is $12 \\times 5 = 60$ square cm.\n\nTo find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the rectangle around its greater side, we first need to visualize what this shape looks like.

Let x be an arbitrary element in P(A) ∩ P(B). By definition of intersection, this means that x is in P(A) and x is in P(B).\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element y in A ∩ B. Since y is in A ∩ B, y is in A and y is in B by definition of intersection. This means that {y} is a subset of A and {y} is a subset of B. Since x is in P(A) and P(B), x must contain all possible subsets of A and all possible subsets of B. Therefore, {y} must be a subset of x.\n\nSince y was an arbitrary element in A ∩ B, this implies that every element in A ∩ B is a subset of x. Thus, x contains all possible subsets of A ∩ B, which means that x is in P(A ∩ B).\n\nTherefore, for all sets A and B, if x is in both P(A) and P(B), then x is also in P(A ∩ B).

That means x belongs to A and x belongs to both B and C. Since x belongs to both B and C, it also belongs to their intersection (B ∩ C). Therefore, x belongs to A and x belongs to (B ∩ C), which means x belongs to A ∩ (B ∩ C).\n\nNow, let's consider an element y that belongs to the right side of the equation.

The complement of a set A, denoted as A', contains all elements that are not in A.\n2. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, contains all elements that are common to both A and B.\n3. The empty set, denoted as ∅, contains no elements.\n4. The subset relation, denoted as A ⊆ B, holds when every element of A is also an element of B.\n\nNow, we can proceed with the proof:\n\n(⇒) Suppose A ⊆ B. Then for any x ∈ A, we have x ∈ B by definition of subset. Therefore, there are no elements in A that are not in B, which means A ∩ B' = ∅. This shows that A ⊆ B implies A ∩ B' = ∅.\n\n(⇐) Conversely, suppose A ∩ B' = ∅. This means there are no elements in A that are not in B. For any x ∈ A, we have x ∈ B, so A ⊆ B by definition of subset. This shows that A ∩ B' = ∅ implies A ⊆ B.\n\nCombining these two implications, we have proven that A ⊆ B if and only if A ∩ B' = ∅.

The odd numbers are those that are not divisible by 2, while the prime numbers are those that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Let's list them out:\n\nOdd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\nPrime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\n\nNow, let's combine these lists to get the elements of set D:\n\nD = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the elements of set D using the union operation on sets A and B, we should remove duplicates from this list. So, the final list of elements for set D is:\n\nD = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}\n\nAfter removing duplicates, we get:\n\nD = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}\n\nSo, the elements of set D are:\n\n$\\boxed{D = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\\}}$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\{1,2,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19\\}}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, let's find the elements in sets A and B.\nSet A contains all positive integers greater than or equal to 5. So, A = {5, 6, 7, ...}.\nSet B contains all positive integers such that 5x < 12. Solving this inequality gives x < 2.4. Since x must be a positive integer, the largest possible value for x is 2. Therefore, B = {1, 2}.\nNow, let's find the intersection of sets A and B, which is set C. The intersection contains all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B, so A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. Since the intersection is the empty set, its cardinality is 0. Therefore, n(A ∩ B) = 0.\nNext, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. This is the set of all positive integers less than 5. So, A' = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nFinally, let's find the union of sets A' and B. The union contains all elements that are in either set.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, we need to find the elements in sets A and B.\nFor set A, we have $3x \\ge 25$. Solving for x gives us $x \\ge \\frac{25}{3}$. Since x must be an even integer, the possible values for x are $\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{28}{3}, \\frac{30}{3}, ...$. The smallest value that satisfies this condition is $\\frac{26}{3}$, so the first few elements in set A are $\\{\\frac{26}{3}, \\frac{28}{3}, \\frac{30}{3}, ...\\}$.\nFor set B, we have $5x < 12$. Solving for x gives us $x < \\frac{12}{5}$. Since x must be an even integer, the possible values for x are $-2, -4, -6, ...$. The largest negative value that satisfies this condition is -2, so the last few elements in set B are $\\{-2, -4, -6, ...\\}$.\nTo find the intersection of sets A and B, we look for common elements between the two sets. There are no common elements, so $n(A \\cap B) = 0$.\nTo find the intersection of sets $A'$ and $B'$, we look for elements that are not in either set A or set B. Set $A'$ contains all odd integers greater than or equal to $\\frac{25}{3}$, and set $B'$ contains all positive even integers less than $\\frac{12}{5}$. Again, there are no common elements, so $n(A' \\cap B') = 0$.\nTherefore, the values of $n(A \\cap B)$ and $n(A' \\cap B')$ are both 0.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>0</final>}$.",

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, $A \\setminus B$ represents the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.\n\nNow let's prove both statements:\n\n1) To show that $A \\setminus A = \\emptyset$, we need to show that every element in $A \\setminus A$ is also in $\\emptyset$. By definition of set subtraction, if $x \\in A \\setminus A$, then $x \\in A$ and $x \\notin A$. However, this is a contradiction because an element cannot belong to a set and not belong to the same set at the same time. Therefore, there are no elements in $A \\setminus A$, which means $A \\setminus A = \\emptyset$.\n\n2) To show that $A \\setminus (A \\setminus A) = A$, we can use the fact that $A \\setminus A = \\emptyset$ from the first part. So, $A \\setminus (A \\setminus A) = A \\setminus \\emptyset$. Since the empty set contains no elements, removing it from any set will not change the original set.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to first understand what each operation in the given expression means. The symbol $\\cap$ represents intersection between sets, which means that we are looking for elements that are common to both sets involved in the operation. The symbol $\\cup$ represents union between sets, which means that we are combining all elements from both sets involved in the operation. Finally, the prime symbol ($'$) denotes the complement of a set, which means that we are taking all elements in the universal set that are not in the specified set.\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them one by one:\n\n1. Find $A \\cap B$: This is the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$. We look for elements that are common to both sets. From the given information, we can see that there are no such elements. Therefore, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$ (the empty set).\n\n2. Find $A \\cap B'$: This is the intersection of set $A$ and the complement of set $B$. Since $B = \\{c, y\\}$, its complement $B'$ consists of all elements in the universal set $U$ that are not in $B$, i.e., $B' = \\{a, b, x, z\\}$. Now, let's find the intersection of $A$ and $B'$. Again, there are no common elements, so $A \\cap B' = \\emptyset$.\n\n3. Combine results: Now that we have found $A \\cap B$ and $A \\cap B'$, we can combine these results using the union operation. However, since both of these intersections resulted in the empty set, their union will also be the empty set. \n\nSo, the final result is $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap B') = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{empty}}$.",

We can use synthetic division to perform this division and find the value of $a$.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n2 & 1 & -5 & 7 & 0 & -a \\\\\n& & 2 & -6 & 2 & \\\\\n\\hline\n& 1 & -3 & 1 & 0 & -(a+2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe remainder is $-a - 2$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We have been given that P(a, b, c) = abc and we need to prove that Q = a^{-3} + b^{-3} + c^{-3} - 3a^{-1}b^{-1}c^{-1}. Let's first simplify the expression for Q using the identity x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz), which holds true for all real numbers x, y, and z. Applying this identity to our expression, we get:\n\nQ = [(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)] / (abc)\n\nNow, let's substitute P(a, b, c) = abc into the above equation:\n\nQ = [(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)] / P(a, b, c)\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator as follows:\n\nP(a, b, c) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c)[(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/2]\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for Q, we get:\n\nQ = 2[(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)] / [(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)]\n\nCancelling out the common terms, we are left with:\n\nQ = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) / (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\nNow, let's use another identity, namely (x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy, where x and y are arbitrary real numbers. This gives us:\n\nQ = 2[((a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2) / (2(ab + bc + ca))]\n\nFinally, substituting P(a, b, c) = abc again, we obtain:\n\nQ = ((a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2) / P(a, b, c)\n\nThis completes the proof that if P(a, b, c) = abc, then Q = a^{-3} + b^{-3} + c^{-3} - 3a^{-1}b^{-1}c^{-1}. Now, let's move on to proving the second part of the problem statement.\n\nGiven that P(a, b, c) = abc, we want to show that (a + b + c)^7 = a^7 + b^7 + c^7. To do this, we will use the identity (x + y + z)^n = Σ_{k=0}^n C(n, k) * (Σ_{i=1}^k x_i)^n, where C(n, k) denotes the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\", and the sum is taken over all distinct permutations of the indices i from 1 to k. For n = 7, this simplifies to:\n\n(a + b + c)^7 = C(7, 1) * (a + b + c) + C(7, 2) * (ab + bc + ca) + C(7, 3) * (abc)\n\nSince P(a, b, c) = abc, we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\n(a + b + c)^7 = 7(a + b + c) + 21(ab + bc + ca) + 35 * abc\n\nNow, let's recall the definition of P(a, b, c):\n\nP(a, b, c) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = abc\n\nDividing both sides of this equation by abc, we get:\n\n(ab + bc + ca) / abc = 1 / (a + b + c)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for (a + b + c)^7, we obtain:\n\n(a + b + c)^7 = 7(a + b + c) + 21/((a + b + c)) + 35\n\nNow, let's factor out (a + b + c) from each term:\n\n(a + b + c)^7 = (a + b + c)[7 + 21/(a + b + c) + 35/((a + b + c))]\n\nFinally, we can see that the expression inside the square brackets is equal to 1:\n\n7 + 21/(a + b + c) + 35/((a + b + c)) = 1\n\nThus, we have shown that (a + b + c)^7 = a^7 + b^7 + c^7. Therefore, the two statements are equivalent, and we have proven what was asked:\n\n$\\frac{1}{(a+b+c)^7} = \\frac{1}{a^7} + \\frac{1}{b^7} + \\frac{1}{c^7}$",

    "question": "Solve: $6\\sqrt{\\frac{2x}{x-1}} + 5\\sqrt{\\frac{x-1}{2x}} = 13$",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To solve this equation, we can use the substitution method. Let's set $u = \\sqrt{\\frac{2x}{x-1}}$ and $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{x-1}{2x}}$. Then, the equation becomes $6u + 5v = 13$. We also have the equations $u^2 = \\frac{2x}{x-1}$ and $v^2 = \\frac{x-1}{2x}$. Multiplying these two equations together, we get $u^2v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $uv = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Now, we can substitute $u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}v}$ into the equation $6u + 5v = 13$, which gives us $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}v} + 5v = 13$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} + 5\\sqrt{2}v^2 - 13v = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $v$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula. The solutions for $v$ are approximately $0.7894$ and $1.4495$. Substituting these values back into the equation $uv = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we find that the corresponding values for $u$ are approximately $0.6180$ and $0.7245$. Finally, substituting these values back into the original equations $u^2 = \\frac{2x}{x-1}$ and $v^2 = \\frac{x-1}{2x}$, we can solve for $x$. The solutions for $x$ are approximately $3.6180$ and $2.7245$.

    "question": "Solve: $x^2-xy=14, y^2+xy=60$",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together. This gives us $(x^2 - xy) + (y^2 + xy) = 14 + 60$, which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 74$. Now we have a new equation that relates $x$ and $y$ without having them cancel each other out when added together.\nNext, let's subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(x^2 - xy) - (y^2 + xy) = 14 - 60$, which simplifies to $x^2 - y^2 = -46$. Since $x^2 - y^2$ factors as $(x + y)(x - y)$, we have another equation relating $x$ and $y$.\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 &= 74 \\\\\n(x + y)(x - y) &= -46\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use these equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$. From the first equation, we know that $x^2 + y^2 = 74$. Squaring both sides of the second equation, we get $(x + y)^2(x - y)^2 = (-46)^2$. Expanding, we have $(x^2 + 2xy + y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 2116$. Using the fact that $x^2 + y^2 = 74$, we can substitute and simplify to get $(74 + 2xy)(74 - 2xy) = 2116$. Expanding again, we have $5476 - 484xy + 4xy^2 = 2116$. Rearranging terms, we get $4xy^2 - 484xy + 3360 = 0$. Dividing through by 4, we have $xy^2 - 121xy + 840 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(x - 7)(y - 5)(xy - 12) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we have three possible cases:\nCase 1: $x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7$\nCase 2: $y - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 5$\nCase 3: $xy - 12 = 0 \\Rightarrow xy = 12$\nSubstituting these values back into the original equations, we can check which case gives valid solutions for $x$ and $y$. After checking, we find that only Case 1 and Case 2 give real solutions. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is either $(x, y) = (7, 5)$ or $(x, y) = (5, 7)$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Let's denote the sides of the two squares as $a$ and $b$. The problem gives us two equations based on the information given:\n\n1) The sum of the areas of the two squares is 481 square metres. Since the area of a square is given by the square of its side length, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 481$.\n\n2) The area of the rectangle formed by the two sides of the two squares is 240 square metres. This means that $ab = 240$.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Here I will use the elimination method. First, let's rewrite equation (2) as $b = \\frac{240}{a}$ and substitute into equation (1):\n\n$$a^2 + \\left(\\frac{240}{a}\\right)^2 = 481.$$\n\nSimplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $a^2$:\n\n$$a^4 + 240^2 = 481a^2.$$\n\nRearrange terms to form a quadratic equation:\n\n$$a^4 - 481a^2 + 240^2 = 0.$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $a^2$, so we can solve for $a^2$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$a^2 = \\frac{-(-481) \\pm \\sqrt{(-481)^2 - 4*1*240^2}}{2*1}.$$\n\nSolving this gives two possible values for $a^2$: approximately $275.69$ and $105.31$. However, since $a$ represents a side length, it must be positive, so we discard the negative root. Therefore, $a^2 \\approx 275.69$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $a \\approx 16.6$.\n\nSubstitute $a \\approx 16.6$ back into equation (2) to find $b$:\n\n$$b = \\frac{240}{a} \\approx \\frac{240}{16.6} \\approx 14.42.$$\n\nSo, the sides of the two squares are approximately $16.6$ and $14.42$ units long.\n\nTherefore, the solution is $\\boxed{\\text{the lengths of a side of each of the squares are approximately } 16.6 \\text{ and } 14.42}$.",

We have the following system of equations based on the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 &= 250 \\\\\nxy &= 117\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as $(x+y)^2 - 2xy = 250$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2xy = 250$, and further simplifies to $(x+y)^2 = 250 + 2*117 = 484$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $x+y = \\pm 22$.\n\nSince we know that $x$ and $y$ are both positive, we take the positive solution, so $x+y = 22$.\n\nNow we can solve for $x$ and $y$ using the second equation $xy = 117$. Since we know that $x+y = 22$, we can use this to form another quadratic equation: $x^2 - 22x + 117 = 0$. This factors into $(x-9)(x-13) = 0$, giving us solutions $x=9$ and $x=13$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length of the rectangle as $L$ and the breadth as $B$. According to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) Twice the breadth is 23 metres more than the length: $2B = L + 23$.\n\n2) The area of the rectangle is 600 square metres: $L \\times B = 600$.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $L$ and $B$. First, let's express $L$ from equation 1: $L = 2B - 23$. Now substitute this into equation 2: $(2B - 23) \\times B = 600$. This simplifies to $2B^2 - 23B - 600 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which can be solved using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 2$, $b = -23$, and $c = -600$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula gives us:\n\n$B = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{(-23)^2 - 4*2*(-600)}}{2*2} = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{529 + 4800}}{4} = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{5329}}{4} = \\frac{23 \\pm 73}{4}$.\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for $B$: $B_1 = \\frac{23 + 73}{4} = \\frac{96}{4} = 24$ and $B_2 = \\frac{23 - 73}{4} = \\frac{-50}{4} = -12.5$. However, since the breadth cannot be negative, we discard the second solution and take $B = 24$.\n\nNow, substituting $B = 24$ into equation 1 gives us $L = 2*24 - 23 = 48 - 23 = 25$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length of the rectangle as $l$ and the breadth as $b$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula $\\sqrt{l^2 + b^2}$. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by $2(l+b)$ and the area is given by $lb$. We are given that the perimeter is 8 metres more than the sum of the diagonals, which gives us the equation $2(l+b) = \\sqrt{l^2 + b^2} + 8$. Also, we know that the area is 48 square metres, so $lb = 48$. Now we have two equations and two unknowns, which we can solve simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express $l$ in terms of $b$ as $l = \\frac{48}{b}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $2\\left(\\frac{48}{b}+b\\right) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{48}{b}\\right)^2 + b^2} + 8$. Solving this equation for $b$, we find that $b = 6$ or $b = -8$. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we take $b = 6$. Substituting this back into the equation $l = \\frac{48}{b}$, we find that $l = 8$.

    "question": "If a number of two digits be divided by the product of its digits, the quotient is 2. When 27 is added to the number, the digits in the number change their places. Find the number.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the tens digit as $a$ and the units digit as $b$. Therefore, the original number can be expressed as $10a + b$. The product of the digits is $ab$, so we have the equation $\\frac{10a + b}{ab} = 2$. Simplifying this gives us $10a + b = 2ab$. Rearranging terms, we get $2ab - b = 10a$, which simplifies further to $b(2a - 1) = 10a$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both integers between 1 and 9, the possible values for $(a, b)$ that satisfy this equation are $(5, 10)$, $(6, 12)$, $(7, 14)$, $(8, 16)$, and $(9, 18)$. However, since $b$ represents a digit, it must be a single digit number, so we discard $(5, 10)$ because $10$ is not a single digit number. Similarly, we discard $(6, 12)$ because $12$ has more than one digit. We also discard $(7, 14)$ and $(8, 16)$ because they do not represent valid numbers when plugged back into the original equation. Finally, we check $(9, 18)$ and find that it satisfies all conditions. So, the original number is $10 \\cdot 9 + 18 = 90 + 18 = 108$.\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition where adding 27 to the number changes the digits. This means that $108 + 27 = 135$, which does indeed have the digits reversed compared to the original number.\n\nTherefore, the number we are looking for is $\\boxed{108}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{108}$.\n<final>108</final>",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let $l$ and $b$ be the length and breadth respectively. Then we have $\\frac{1}{2}(l+b) = lb + 10$. Squaring both sides gives us $(l+b)^2 = 4lb + 400 \\implies l^2 + b^2 + 2lb = 4lb + 400$, which simplifies to $l^2 - 2lb + b^2 = 400 \\implies (l-b)^2 = 400.$ Therefore, $l-b = 20$ or $l-b=-20$. Since $l > b$, we get that $l=b+20$. Substituting this into our original equation from above yields $$\\frac{1}{2} (2b+20)=b(b+20)+10\\Rightarrow b^2+10b=0.$$ Thus, $b(b+10)=0$ so either $b=0$ or $b=-10$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We know that distance = rate x time. Therefore, we can write two equations based on the given information:\n\nEquation 1: $x = r_1 * 4$, where $r_1$ represents the rate of the car when it travels $x$ km.\n\nEquation 2: $x + 120 = r_2 * 5$, where $r_2$ represents the rate of the car when it travels $(x + 120)$ km.\n\nWe also know that the average speed of the car does not exceed 100 km/hour. This means that the maximum value for both $r_1$ and $r_2$ is 100 km/hour.\n\nNow let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom Equation 1, we get $r_1 = \\frac{x}{4}$. Since $r_1$ should not exceed 100 km/hour, we have $\\frac{x}{4} \\leq 100$. Solving this inequality gives us $x \\leq 400$.\n\nFrom Equation 2, we get $r_2 = \\frac{x + 120}{5}$. Again, since $r_2$ should not exceed 100 km/hour, we have $\\frac{x + 120}{5} \\leq 100$. Solving this inequality gives us $x \\leq -600$.\n\nSince $x$ must satisfy both inequalities, we take the intersection of their solution sets, which gives us $-600 \\leq x \\leq 400$. However, since $x$ represents a distance, it must be non-negative. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are those in the interval $[0, 400]$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{\\begin{cases} [0, 400] & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\ \\emptyset & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}}$.",

But on way from Dhaka to Singapore, it faces air flowing at 100 km/hour from the opposite direction. Express the time required for the non-stop flight from Dhaka to Singapore in terms of an inequality.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To find the total time taken for the non-stop flight from Dhaka to Singapore, we need to consider both the speed of the plane and the speed of the air flowing in the opposite direction. Let's denote the speed of the plane as $v$ and the speed of the air as $u$. We have two cases here:\n\nCase 1: When the plane flies against the wind, its effective speed decreases due to the opposing force of the wind. In this case, the effective speed becomes $(v - u)$. So, the time taken for this leg of the journey can be expressed as $\\frac{d}{v - u}$, where $d$ is the distance between Dhaka and Singapore.\n\nCase 2: When the plane flies with the wind, its effective speed increases due to the aiding force of the wind. In this case, the effective speed becomes $(v + u)$. So, the time taken for this leg of the journey can be expressed as $\\frac{d}{v + u}$.\n\nSince we want to express the total time required for the non-stop flight, we add the times taken for both legs of the journey:\n\n$\\frac{d}{v - u} + \\frac{d}{v + u}$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2900}{900 - 100} + \\frac{2900}{900 + 100}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2900}{800} + \\frac{2900}{1000}$\n\n$= 3.625 + 2.9$\n\n$= 6.525$ hours\n\nTherefore, the time required for the non-stop flight from Dhaka to Singapore is less than or equal to 6.525 hours.

Since the initial distance was 1 km., the total distance covered by each dog approaches infinity as the number of times the dogs meet increases because the sum of infinite geometric series with first term 1/2 and common ratio 1/2 is equal to 1"

    "question": "here are four dogs standing in the four corners of a square area, each side of which is $1$ km. Now, every dog runs blindly towards the dog on its right in the same velocity, covering half the distance. After opening the eyes, they run similarly to the dog on its right again, covering half the distance.\nAnswer the previous question if after covering half the distance, without changing direction each dog covers additional $1/k$ times of the distance and then changes direction.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the position of the first dog as A, the second dog as B, the third dog as C, and the fourth dog as D. Initially, all dogs are located at points A(0, 0), B(1, 0), C(1, 1), and D(0, 1) respectively.\n\nAfter running for some time, let's assume that the first dog has covered x units of distance from point A to point P(x, 0). Since all dogs move at the same speed, the second dog will also cover x units of distance and reach point Q(1 - x, 0). Similarly, the third dog will reach R(1 - x, 1 - x) and the fourth dog will reach S(x, 1 - x).\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of these points when the dogs change their directions k times. We can use recursion to solve this problem. Let's denote the coordinates of the first dog after n turns as (x_n, y_n). Then, we have the following recursive formulas:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{1}{2^k}(1 - x_n)\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{1}{2^k}(1 - y_n)\n\nWe can apply these formulas iteratively until the dogs meet or cross the boundary of the square. The dogs will meet when x_n = y_n, and they will cross the boundary when x_n or y_n exceeds 1.\n\nBy analyzing the behavior of the dogs using the above recursive formulas, we can conclude that the dogs will always meet within the square. Therefore, no matter how many times the dogs change their directions, they will never leave the square.",

Since they form a triangle, we have $a + b + c = \\pi$ (in radians), where $\\pi$ is approximately equal to 3.1416.

We can substitute these conditions into the equation for the sum of the angles to get $a + (a + d) + (2a + d) = \\pi$, where $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic progression.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The distance covered by the person jogging is equal to the length of the arc subtending an angle of $60^\\circ$ at the centre of the circular track. This can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle, $C = \\pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the circle. Since we know that the person has jogged for $36$ seconds at a speed of $6$ km/hr, we can calculate the distance they have traveled as follows:\n\nFirst, convert the speed from km/hr to m/s by dividing by $3.6$: $6 \\text{ km/hr} / 3.6 = 1.67 \\text{ m/s}$.\nThen, multiply this speed by the time to find the distance: $1.67 \\text{ m/s} \\times 36 \\text{ s} = 60 \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, since the angle subtended by the arc is $60^\\circ$, and the total angle around the circle is $360^\\circ$, we can find the fraction of the circumference that corresponds to the arc length: $\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the arc is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the circumference of the circle, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{6} C = 60$ m.

Also, we know that $\\sin \\theta$ is negative, so $\\cos \\theta$ must also be negative. Therefore, both $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ have opposite signs. \n\nNow, let's consider the expression $\\frac{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta}{\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta}$. We can rewrite this as $\\frac{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta}{\\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta} + \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}}$. Simplifying further, we get $\\frac{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta}{\\frac{\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}}$. Cancelling out the common factor of $(\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta)$, we are left with $\\cos \\theta$. \n\nSince we know that $\\cos \\theta$ is negative from our earlier observation, we can substitute $-\\cos \\theta$ into the equation. Now, we need to find the value of $\\cos \\theta$. Using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$, we can solve for $\\cos \\theta$:\n\n$(\\frac{3}{4})^2 + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$\n\n$\\frac{9}{16} + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$\n\n$\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\frac{9}{16}$\n\n$\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{7}{16}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get two possible solutions: $\\cos \\theta = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4}$. Since we know that $\\cos \\theta$ is negative, we take the negative solution: $\\cos \\theta = -\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the original expression, we get $\\frac{\\sin \\theta + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4})}{\\sec \\theta + \\tan \\theta}$. Simplifying further, we get $\\frac{-\\frac{3}{4}}{\\frac{1}{-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4}} + \\frac{3}{4}}$. \n\nSolving this gives us $\\frac{-\\frac{3}{4}}{-\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{7}}}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula. In this case, we'll use factoring. The equation factors as $(2\\sin \\theta - 1)(3\\sin \\theta - 4) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us $2\\sin \\theta - 1 = 0$ and $3\\sin \\theta - 4 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4}{3}$. However, since $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the sine function has a range of $-1 \\leq \\sin \\theta \\leq 1$, so there is no solution for $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4}{3}$. Therefore, the only valid solution is $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. Taking the inverse sine of both sides gives us $\\theta = \\arcsin \\frac{1}{2}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To solve this equation, we can use the identity $\\tan \\theta + \\cot \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta}$. So, our equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Squaring both sides, we get $\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta} = \\frac{16}{3}$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $\\frac{3}{\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta} = 16$. Using the double angle formula for sine squared, we know that $\\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta$. Substituting this into our equation, we get $\\frac{3}{(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta) \\cos^2 \\theta} = 16$. Simplifying, we have $3 - 3\\cos^2 \\theta = 16\\cos^2 \\theta$. Combining like terms, we get $19\\cos^2 \\theta = 3$. Dividing both sides by $19$, we have $\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{3}{19}$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First we need to find out how much distance the person has to travel from Dhaka to Panchagarh. The circumference of the circle formed by the radius joining the two cities would be the distance between them. We know that the formula for the circumference of a circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Here $\\pi$ is approximately taken as $3.14$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: In this case, we know that the circumference of the circle is equal to the length of the arc AB, which is given as $25$ cm. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the radius is half the diameter, we can also write this as $C = \\pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the circle.\n\nSince the length of arc AB is equal to the circumference of the circle, we have $25 = \\pi d$. Solving for $d$, we get $d = \\frac{25}{\\pi}$.\n\nNow, let's find the angle $\\theta$ in degrees. We know that the circumference of the circle corresponds to an angle of $360^\\circ$. Therefore, the ratio of the length of arc AB to the circumference of the circle is equal to the ratio of the angle $\\theta$ to $360^\\circ$. This gives us the equation $\\frac{25}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ}$.\n\nSubstituting $r = \\frac{d}{2}$, we get $\\frac{25}{2\\pi (\\frac{d}{2})} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ}$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{25}{\\pi d} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ}$. Substituting $d = \\frac{25}{\\pi}$, we get $\\frac{25}{\\pi (\\frac{25}{\\pi})} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ}$.

Then, we can factor this expression using the difference of squares formula: $(a^{\\frac{3}{2}})^2 + (a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})^2 = [(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})]/[(a^{\\frac{3}{2}})^2 - (a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})^2]$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into the original equation: $\\frac{(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}) + 1}{(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})(a^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{-\\frac{3}{2}})}$.\n\nWe can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator: $\\frac{1}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nFinally, let's multiply both the numerator and denominator by $a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$ to get rid of the negative exponent in the denominator: $\\frac{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}}} = a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}} - 1$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\frac{a^3 + a^{-3} + 1}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}} + 1} = a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}} - 1$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{<final>Answer: } a^{\\frac{3}{2}} + a^{-\\frac{3}{2}} - 1\\text{ </final>}}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We have $a^x = p$, $a^y = q$, and $a^z = (p^y q^x)^2$. Taking the logarithm base $a$ of both sides of each equation gives us $x = \\log_a p$, $y = \\log_a q$, and $z = 2(\\log_a p + \\log_a q)$. Using the property $\\log_a b + \\log_a c = \\log_a (bc)$, we can simplify $z$ as $z = 2\\log_a (pq)$. Therefore, $xyz = (\\log_a p)(\\log_a q)(2\\log_a (pq)) = 2(\\log_a p)(\\log_a q)(\\log_a (pq))$. Applying the change of base formula for logarithms, we get $xyz = 2\\left(\\frac{\\log p}{\\log a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\log q}{\\log a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\log (pq)}{\\log a}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\log p \\cdot \\log q \\cdot \\log (pq)}{(\\log a)^3}\\right)$.

Substituting this into our expression gives $xyz = 2(\\log p \\cdot \\log q \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log_{pq} a})$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To solve this system of equations, we can first rewrite the given expressions using the same base for both sides of each equation. We know that $4=2^2$ and $16=2^4$, so we can rewrite the first equation as $(2^2)^{3y-2}=(2^4)^{x+y}$. Similarly, we know that $3=3^1$ and $9=3^2$, so we can rewrite the second equation as $(3^1)^{x+2y}=(3^2)^{2x+1}$.\n\nSimplifying these expressions gives us $2^{6y-4}=2^{4x+4y}$ and $3^{x+2y}=3^{4x+2}$.\n\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must also be equal. Therefore, we have two new systems of equations:\n\n1) $6y-4=4x+4y$ and $x+2y=4x+2$.\n\nLet's solve the first equation from the first system: $6y-4=4x+4y$ simplifies to $2y=4x+4$, which further simplifies to $y=2x+2$.\n\nNow let's substitute this into the second equation from the first system: $x+(2x+2)=4x+2$ simplifies to $3x+2=4x+2$, which further simplifies to $x=0$.\n\nSubstituting $x=0$ back into $y=2x+2$ gives us $y=2$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the first system of equations is $x=0$ and $y=2$.\n\nNow let's check this solution in the second system of equations: $x+2y=4x+2$ becomes $0+4=4(0)+2$, which simplifies to $4=2$.

Then we have three equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx = y \\\\\ny = z \\\\\nx = z\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFrom these equations, we can see that $x = y = z$. Now let's substitute this back into our original equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\log_k a}{b-c} = x \\\\\n\\frac{\\log_k b}{c-a} = x \\\\\n\\frac{\\log_k c}{a-b} = x\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nMultiplying all three equations together, we get:\n\\[\n(\\log_k a)(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c) = x^3(b-c)(c-a)(a-b)\n\\]\nSince $x = \\frac{\\log_k a}{b-c}$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n(\\log_k a)(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c) = (\\log_k a)^3(b-c)^2\n\\]\nDividing both sides by $(\\log_k a)^3$, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2} = (b-c)^2\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we obtain:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2}} = |b-c|\n\\]\nNow, let's consider two cases:\nCase 1: $|b-c| = b-c$\nIn this case, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2}} = b-c\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2} = (b-c)^2\n\\]\nThis is the same equation we derived earlier, so this case leads us back to where we started.\nCase 2: $|b-c| = -(b-c)$\nIn this case, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2}} = -(b-c)\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2} = (b-c)^2\n\\]\nAgain, this is the same equation we derived earlier, so this case also leads us back to where we started.\nTherefore, regardless of which case we consider, we always end up with the same equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\log_k b)(\\log_k c)}{(\\log_k a)^2} = (b-c)^2\n\\]\nNow, let's use the property of logarithms that $\\log_a b = \\frac{1}{\\log_b a}$.

Using the approximation up to the fourth term, we get:\n\n$(1.01)^{8} \\approx 1 + 8(0.01) + 28(0.01)^2 + 56(0.01)^3$\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n$(1.01)^{8} \\approx 1 + 0.08 + 0.0028 + 0.000056$\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\n$(1.01)^{8} \\approx 1.082856$\n\nSo, the value of $(1.01)^{8}$ is approximately $1.0829$ when rounded to four decimal places.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To find the coefficient of $x^7$ in the expansion of AB, we need to consider the terms that will multiply together to give $x^7$. In A, there are two possible ways this can happen: either $(1+x)$ contributes an $x^7$, which happens when its power is increased from 0 to 7, or $x$ contributes an $x^6$, which happens when its power is increased from 0 to 6. Similarly, in B, $x$ contributes an $x^7$ when its power is increased from 0 to 7. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:\nCase 1: The term comes from $(1+x)^7$ and has an $x^7$: This gives us $\\binom{7}{7}(1)^{7-7}x^7=x^7$.\nCase 2: The term comes from $(1+x)^7$ and has an $x^6$: This gives us $\\binom{7}{6}(1)^{7-6}x^6=\\frac{7}{1}x^6$.\nCase 3: The term comes from $(1-x)^8$ and has an $x^7$: This gives us $\\binom{8}{7}(1)^{8-7}(-x)^7=-\\frac{8}{1}x^7$.\nAdding these up, we get $x^7+\\frac{7}{1}x^6-\\frac{8}{1}x^7=-x^7+\\frac{7}{1}x^6$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The total area required for all the students is $70 \\times 4.25 = 297.5$ square meters. Since the length of the room is given as 34 meters, we can find the width and height by setting up two equations based on the volume formula $V = lwh$. We know that $l = 34$, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height. So we have:\n\n$34wh = 13.6 \\times 70$\n\nAnd also:\n\n$34w^2 = 297.5$\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of $w$ and $h$. From the second equation, we get $w^2 = \\frac{297.5}{34} = 8.75$, so $w = \\sqrt{8.75} = 2.9580$. Substituting this value into the first equation gives $34(2.9580)h = 13.6 \\times 70$, which simplifies to $h = \\frac{13.6 \\times 70}{34 \\times 2.9580} = 13.6$.

    "question": "The outer diameter of a hollow sphere is 13 cm and the thickness of the iron is 2 cm. A solid sphere is formed with the iron used in the hollow sphere. What will be its diameter?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The volume of the iron used for the hollow sphere can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Since we know the outer diameter of the hollow sphere and the thickness of the iron, we can calculate the inner diameter of the hollow sphere and use that as the diameter of the solid sphere formed from the iron. Let's denote the outer diameter of the hollow sphere as D_outer, the thickness of the iron as t, and the diameter of the solid sphere as D_solid. We have:\n\nD_outer = 13 cm\nt = 2 cm\n\nThe outer radius of the hollow sphere, R_outer, is half of the outer diameter, so R_outer = D_outer / 2 = 13 / 2 = 6.5 cm.\n\nThe inner radius of the hollow sphere, R_inner, is the outer radius minus the thickness of the iron, so R_inner = R_outer - t = 6.5 - 2 = 4.5 cm.\n\nSince the solid sphere is formed from the iron used in the hollow sphere, its radius is equal to the inner radius of the hollow sphere, so R_solid = R_inner = 4.5 cm.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the solid sphere, D_solid, is twice the radius, so D_solid = 2 * R_solid = 2 * 4.5 = 9 cm.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",

    "question": "A solid sphere of radius 4 cm. is melted into a uniform hollow sphere of outer radius 5 cm. Find the thickness of the second sphere.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The volume of the first sphere can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = (4/3)πr^3. In this case, the radius r1 is 4 cm. So the volume of the first sphere is V1 = (4/3)π(4)^3 = (256/3)π cubic cm.\n\nThe volume of the second sphere can also be calculated using the same formula, but we know that it's a hollow sphere, so its inner radius r2 and outer radius r3 need to be considered. We are given that the outer radius r3 is 5 cm. Let's denote the thickness of the second sphere as t = r3 - r2. Then r2 = r3 - t = 5 - t.\n\nSince the first sphere was melted into the second sphere, their volumes should be equal. Therefore, we have V1 = V2, where V2 = (4/3)π[r3^3 - r2^3] = (4/3)π[(5)^3 - (5 - t)^3].\n\nSubstituting V1 into the equation gives us (256/3)π = (4/3)π[(5)^3 - (5 - t)^3]. Simplifying both sides, we get 256 = 125 - (5 - t)^3. Rearranging terms, we obtain (5 - t)^3 = 125 - 256 = -131. Taking the cube root of both sides, we find 5 - t = (-131)^(1/3). Solving for t, we get t = 5 - (-131)^(1/3).\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that (-131)^(1/3) is approximately -5.079. Therefore, t = 5 - (-5.079) = 10.079 cm.\n\nSo the thickness of the second sphere is approximately 10.079 cm.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>Answer: 10.079 cm</final>}$.",

    "question": "How many bricks each of length 25 cm., breadth 12.5 cm. and height 8 cm. will be required to construct a wall of height 2 metres and thickness 25 cm. around a rectangular garden with length 120 metres and width 90 metres?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, let's calculate the volume of the wall. The wall has two sides, one on the outside and one on the inside. The outside side of the wall is just the garden dimensions plus the wall thickness added to both length and width. So the outside side of the wall is $2 \\times (120 + 2 \\times 0.25) \\times (90 + 2 \\times 0.25)$ cubic meters. The inside side of the wall is just the garden dimensions, so it's $2 \\times 120 \\times 90$ cubic meters. Therefore, the total volume of the wall is $(2 \\times (120 + 2 \\times 0.25) \\times (90 + 2 \\times 0.25)) - (2 \\times 120 \\times 90)$ cubic meters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the volume of a brick. A brick has three dimensions: length, breadth, and height. So the volume of a brick is $25 \\times 12.5 \\times 8$ cubic centimeters. To convert this to cubic meters, we divide by $100^3$, since there are $100^3 = 1,000,000$ cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. So the volume of a brick is $\\frac{25 \\times 12.5 \\times 8}{100^3}$ cubic meters.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many bricks are needed. We divide the total volume of the wall by the volume of a brick. This gives us the number of bricks needed for the entire wall. Since each brick covers a volume equal to its own volume, rounding up to the nearest whole number ensures that all the wall's volume can be covered.\n\nSo the number of bricks needed is $\\lceil \\frac{(2 \\times (120 + 2 \\times 0.25) \\times (90 + 2 \\times 0.25)) - (2 \\times 120 \\times 90)}{\\frac{25 \\times 12.5 \\times 8}{100^3}} \\rceil$.\n\nCalculating this expression gives approximately $676.57...$. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we find that approximately $677$ bricks are needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{677}}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as l, w, and h respectively. Given that the length and width are in the ratio 4:3, we can express them as 4x and 3x for some positive number x. Also, given that the volume of the box is 2304 cubic centimeters, we have the equation:\n\nlwh = 2304\n(4x)(3x)(h) = 2304\n12x^2 * h = 2304\nx^2 * h = 192\n\nNow, let's consider the cost of making a solid with lead coating at the bottom at Tk. 10 per square centimetre. Since the lead will cover all sides except the top, the area to be coated is equal to the surface area minus the area of the top face. This gives us the equation:\n\nCost = 10 * (2lw + 2lh + 2wh - wh)\n1920 = 10 * (8x^2 + 6xh + 6xh - 3x^2)\n192 = 8x^2 + 12xh - 3x^2\n5x^2 + 12xh = 192\n\nWe now have two equations:\n\n1) x^2 * h = 192\n2) 5x^2 + 12xh = 192\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express h in terms of x:\n\nh = 192 / x^2\n\nSubstituting this into equation (2) gives:\n\n5x^2 + 12x(192 / x^2) = 192\n5x^4 + 2304 = 192x^2\n5x^4 - 192x^2 + 2304 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x^2.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The area of the base of the cone is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the base. Since we want to enclose a land of 2000 square metres, we have $\\pi r^2 = 2000$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi}}$.\nThe volume of the cone is given by $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$, where $h$ is the height of the cone. Substituting the values, we have $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (\\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi}})^2 (7.5) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{2000}{\\pi} \\cdot 7.5 = 5000$ cubic metres.\nSince the amount of canvas needed is proportional to the surface area of the cone, and the surface area of a cone is given by $\\pi r l + \\pi r^2$, where $l$ is the slant height of the cone, we need to find the value of $l$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $l = \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$. Substituting the values, we get $l = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi}})^2 + (7.5)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi} + 56.25}$.\nTherefore, the amount of canvas needed is given by $\\pi r l + \\pi r^2 = \\pi (\\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi}})(\\sqrt{\\frac{2000}{\\pi} + 56.25}) + \\pi (\\frac{2000}{\\pi}) = 2000\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{56.25}{2000/\\pi}} + 2000$.\nSimplifying, we get $2000\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{56.25\\pi}{2000}} + 2000$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To find the total surface area of a regular hexagonal prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and then add them together. A regular hexagonal prism has two congruent hexagon faces and six rectangular faces.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of one hexagon face. The formula for the area of a regular hexagon is (3 * sqrt(3) * s^2) / 2, where s is the side length of the hexagon. In this case, s = 4 cm. So, the area of one hexagon face is (3 * sqrt(3) * 4^2) / 2 = (3 * sqrt(3) * 16) / 2 = 24 * sqrt(3) square cm. Since there are two hexagon faces, the total area of the hexagon faces is 2 * 24 * sqrt(3) = 48 * sqrt(3) square cm.\n\nNext, let's find the area of one rectangular face. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. In this case, the length is the side length of the hexagon (4 cm), and the width is the height of the prism (5 cm). So, the area of one rectangular face is 4 * 5 = 20 square cm. Since there are six rectangular faces, the total area of the rectangular faces is 6 * 20 = 120 square cm.\n\nFinally, let's add the areas of the hexagon faces and the rectangular faces to find the total surface area of the prism. Total surface area = 48 * sqrt(3) + 120 square cm.\n\nTo find the volume of a prism, we use the formula V = B * h, where B is the area of the base and h is the height of the prism. In this case, B is the area of one hexagon face (24 * sqrt(3) square cm), and h is the height of the prism (5 cm). So, the volume of the prism is V = 24 * sqrt(3) * 5 = 120 * sqrt(3) cubic cm.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the prism is 48 * sqrt(3) + 120 square cm, and the volume of the prism is 120 * sqrt(3) cubic cm.

    "question": "The lower part of a construction is a parallelopiped of length 3 metres and the upper part is a regular pyramid. If the base of the pyramid is of side 2 metres and the height is 3 metres, find the total area of surfaces and the volume of the construction.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The surface area of the parallelopiped can be found using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. In this case, the length is 3 meters and the width is not given, so we'll call it w. Therefore, the surface area of the parallelopiped is 3w square meters.\n\nThe surface area of the pyramid can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 times base times height. In this case, the base is 2 meters and the height is 3 meters. Therefore, the surface area of each triangular face of the pyramid is 1/2 * 2 * 3 = 3 square meters. Since there are four triangular faces on the pyramid, the total surface area of the pyramid is 4 * 3 = 12 square meters.\n\nTo find the total surface area of the construction, we add the surface area of the parallelopiped and the surface area of the pyramid: 3w + 12 square meters.\n\nTo find the volume of the parallelopiped, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height. In this case, the length is 3 meters, the width is w meters, and the height is not given, so we'll call it h. Therefore, the volume of the parallelopiped is 3wh cubic meters.\n\nTo find the volume of the pyramid, we use the formula for the volume of a pyramid, which is 1/3 times the area of the base times the height. In this case, the base is a square with side length 2 meters, so its area is 2 * 2 = 4 square meters. The height is 3 meters. Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is 1/3 * 4 * 3 = 4 cubic meters.\n\nTo find the total volume of the construction, we add the volume of the parallelopiped and the volume of the pyramid: 3wh + 4 cubic meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the construction is 3w + 12 square meters, and the total volume of the construction is 3wh + 4 cubic meters.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The godown has a two-part roof, so we need to calculate the volume for each part separately and then add them together.\nThe dimensions of each part of the roof are as follows:\nLength = 25 meters\nWidth = 14 meters\nHeight = 5 meters - (height of the godown)\nTo find the volume of each part, we multiply the length, width, and height:\nVolume of each part = Length x Width x Height = 25 meters x 14 meters x (5 meters - 0 meters) = 25 meters x 14 meters x 5 meters = 1750 cubic meters\nSince there are two parts to the roof, we multiply the volume of each part by 2:\nTotal volume of the godown = 2 x Volume of each part = 2 x 1750 cubic meters = 3500 cubic meters\nTherefore, the volume of the godown is 3500 cubic meters.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>3500</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To find the slant height of the tent, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The radius of the base is half the diameter, so it's 25 meters. The height of the tent is given as 8 meters. We can consider this as a right triangle with legs of length 25 meters and 8 meters. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ represents the hypotenuse (the slant height), and $a$ and $b$ represent the other two sides.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: The surface area of the tent can be calculated using the formula for the lateral surface area of a cone, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base circumference} \\times \\text{slant height}$. The base circumference is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the base, which is half the diameter, so $r = \\frac{50}{2} = 25$ m.

    "question": "In a certain lottery $570$ tickets have been sold. Rahim has bought $15$ tickets. The tickets are mixed thoroughly and one ticket is drawn at random for the first price. What is the probability of Rahim getting the first prize?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: There are 570 tickets in total and Rahim has bought 15 of them. So, the probability of Rahim getting the first prize is simply the number of tickets he has bought divided by the total number of tickets. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{15}{570}$. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15. This gives us $\\frac{1}{\\frac{570}{15}}$. Simplifying further, we get $\\frac{1}{38}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{38}}$.\n<final>$\\frac{1}{38}$</final>",

    "question": "What is the probability of getting an even number or a number divisible by $3$ in a single throw of a dice?",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: A standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. Half of these numbers are even and half are odd. So the chance of landing on an even number is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, two of the numbers are multiples of 3 (3 and 6), so the chance of landing on a multiple of 3 is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, since 6 is both even and a multiple of 3, we have double counted this outcome. To avoid double counting, we should subtract out the probability that the number is both even and a multiple of 3. There is only one such number (6), so the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore, the total probability of either event happening is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nTherefore, the

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First, let's list out all the elements in sets A and B.\n\nSet A contains all prime numbers from the given universal set U. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The prime numbers from the given universal set U are 2, 3, 5, 7. So, A = {2, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nSet B contains all odd numbers from the given universal set U. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The odd numbers from the given universal set U are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the union and intersection of sets A and B.\n\nThe union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set B or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nThe intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are common to both set A and set B. In this case, A ∩ B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNext, let's find the complements of sets A and B.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Since we don't have a specific universal set defined for this problem, we can assume the universal set U is the set of all integers from 0 to 9. Therefore, A' = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nSimilarly, the complement of set B, denoted as B', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set B. In this case, B' = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\n\nNow, let's find the union and intersection of sets A' and B'.\n\nThe union of sets A' and B', denoted as A' ∪ B', is the set of all elements that are in either set A' or set B' or in both. In this case, A' ∪ B' = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nThe intersection of sets A' and B', denoted as A' ∩ B', is the set of all elements that are common to both set A' and set B'. In this case, A' ∩ B' = {}.\n\nFinally, let's find the complement of the intersection of sets A and B.\n\nThe complement of the intersection of sets A and B, denoted as (A ∩ B)', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in the intersection of sets A and B. In this case, (A ∩ B)' = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nAnd the complement of the union of sets A and B.\n\nThe complement of the union of sets A and B, denoted as (A ∪ B)', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in the union of sets A and B. In this case, (A ∪ B)' = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\nA = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nB = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nA ∩ B = {3, 5, 7}\nA' = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}\nB' = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\nA' ∪ B' = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}\nA' ∩ B' = {}\n(A ∩ B)' = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}\n(A ∪ B)' = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{<final>A={2,3,5,7}, B={1,3,5,7,9}, AUB={1,2,3,5,7,9}, AINTB={3,5,7}, A'={0,1,4,6,8,9}, B'={0,2,4,6,8}, A'UB'={0,1,4,6,8,9}, A'INTB'={}, (AINTB)'={0,1,2,4,6,8,9}, (AUB)'={0,2,4,6,8}</final>}$.",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To check if the function f(x) = 3x + 5 is one-one, we need to see if distinct elements in its domain map to distinct elements in its co-domain. In other words, for any two different values of x1 and x2 in the domain, their corresponding images f(x1) and f(x2) should also be different.\n\nLet's take two arbitrary real numbers x1 and x2 such that x1 ≠ x2. Then,\n\nf(x1) = 3x1 + 5\nf(x2) = 3x2 + 5\n\nNow, let's subtract f(x1) from f(x2),\n\nf(x2) - f(x1) = (3x2 + 5) - (3x1 + 5)\n= 3x2 + 5 - 3x1 - 5\n= 3x2 - 3x1\n= 3(x2 - x1)\n\nSince x1 ≠ x2, (x2 - x1) ≠ 0. Therefore, 3(x2 - x1) ≠ 0. This implies that f(x2) ≠ f(x1). Hence, for every pair of distinct elements x1 and x2 in the domain, their corresponding images under the function f(x) are also distinct. Thus, the function f(x) = 3x + 5 is one-one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{True}}$. The final tag is: <final>Answer: True</final>.",

A critical point occurs where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n\n$$f'(x) = 3$$\n\nSince $f'(x)$ is a constant and does not depend on $x$, there are no critical points within the domain.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f$ is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ between $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can use polynomial long division to divide $(x^2 + 1)(x -6)$ by $2x^2+3$. The dividend is $(x^2 + 1)(x -6) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 6$ and the divisor is $2x^2+3$.\n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend ($x^3$) by the first term of the divisor ($2x^2$), which gives us $\\frac{x^3}{2x^2} = \\frac{1}{2}x$. This is our first term in the quotient.\n\nNext, we multiply the entire divisor ($2x^2+3$) by $\\frac{1}{2}x$, which gives us $\\frac{1}{2}x(2x^2+3) = x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x$. We subtract this from the original dividend to get a new dividend: $x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 6 - (x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x) = -5x^2 - \\frac{11}{2}x + 6$.\n\nWe repeat the process with the new dividend. We divide the first term (-$5x^2$) by the first term of the divisor ($2x^2$), which gives us $-\\frac{5}{2}$. This is our next term in the quotient.\n\nWe multiply the entire divisor ($2x^2+3$) by $-\\frac{5}{2}$, which gives us $-\\frac{5}{2}(2x^2+3) = -5x^2 - \\frac{15}{2}$. We subtract this from the new dividend to get a new dividend: $-5x^2 - \\frac{11}{2}x + 6 - (-5x^2 - \\frac{15}{2}) = -\\frac{9}{2}x + \\frac{12}{2} = -\\frac{9}{2}x + 6$.\n\nFinally, we divide the first term ($-\\frac{9}{2}x$) by the first term of the divisor ($2x^2$), which gives us $-\\frac{9}{4}x$. This is our last term in the quotient.\n\nSo, the quotient when $(x^2 + 1)(x -6)$ is divided by $2x^2+3$ is $\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{9}{4}x$.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To express $\\dfrac{1}{x(x^2+1)^2}$ as a partial fraction, we can use the method of decomposition into simple fractions. We first factorize the denominator $x(x^2+1)^2$. Since $(x^2+1)^2$ has no real roots, we can write $\\dfrac{1}{x(x^2+1)^2}$ as follows:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{x(x^2+1)^2} = \\dfrac{A}{x} + \\dfrac{Bx+C}{(x^2+1)} + \\dfrac{Dx+E}{(x^2+1)^2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x(x^2+1)^2$, we get:\n\n$$1 = A(x^2+1)^2 + (Bx+C)(x^2+1)(x) + (Dx+E)(x)$$\n\nExpanding and collecting like terms, we have:\n\n$$1 = (A + B)x^4 + (2A + C)x^3 + (2A - D)x^2 + (-2B - E)x + (-A - C)$$\n\nSince this equation holds for all $x$, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$ on both sides must be equal. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA + B &= 0 \\\\\n2A + C &= 0 \\\\\n2A - D &= 0 \\\\\n-2B - E &= 0 \\\\\n-A - C &= 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system, we find that $A = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $B = \\frac{1}{2}$, $C = 1$, $D = -1$, and $E = -1$. Therefore, we can express $\\dfrac{1}{x(x^2+1)^2}$ as:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{x(x^2+1)^2} = -\\dfrac{1}{2x} + \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2}x+1}{(x^2+1)} - \\dfrac{x+1}{(x^2+1)^2}$$\n\nSo the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$$\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{2x} + \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2}x+1}{(x^2+1)} - \\dfrac{x+1}{(x^2+1)^2}}$$",

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: Let's denote the side lengths of the two squares as $a$ and $b$. The area of each square is given by squaring its side length, so we have $a^2$ and $b^2$ for the areas of the two squares respectively. According to the problem, the sum of these areas is $650$, which gives us the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 650$.\n\nNext, we know that the area of the rectangle formed by the two sides of the squares is $323$ square metres. Since the area of a rectangle is given by multiplying its length and width, this means that $ab = 323$.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + b^2 &= 650 \\\\\nab &= 323\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Here I will use substitution. From the second equation, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = \\frac{323}{b}$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $\\left(\\frac{323}{b}\\right)^2 + b^2 = 650$. Simplifying this equation gives $104129/b^2 + b^2 = 650$, or $104129 + b^4 = 650b^2$. Rearranging terms gives $b^4 - 650b^2 + 104129 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $b^2$, and we can solve it by factoring: $(b^2 - 257)(b^2 - 409) = 0$. Taking the positive root, we find $b^2 = 409$, so $b = \\sqrt{409}$. Similarly, substituting $b = \\sqrt{409}$ into the equation $ab = 323$ gives $a = \\frac{323}{\\sqrt{409}} = \\sqrt{409}$.\n\nSo the side lengths of the two squares are both $\\sqrt{409}$, but they could either be the same size or different sizes depending on how the rectangles were constructed. Therefore, the lengths of the sides of the two squares are $\\sqrt{409}$ and $\\sqrt{409}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{<final>Answer: \\sqrt{409}</final>}$.",

The product of the digits is $ab$, so we have $\\frac{10a + b}{ab} = 3$. Multiplying both sides by $ab$, we get $10a + b = 3ab$. Rearranging terms, we obtain $3ab - b = 10a$, which simplifies to $b(3a - 1) = 10a$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, they must be integers between 1 and 9 inclusive. We can test these values to find that the only solution is $a = 2$ and $b = 5$. So the original number is $10a + b = 25$.\n\nWhen 18 is added to the number, we get $25 + 18 = 43$, and the digits switch places.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We have two equations here and we need to solve them simultaneously for x and y. The first equation is $x^y = y^x$ which means that x raised to power y equals y raised to power x. And the second equation is $x = 2y$. Let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the first equation so it becomes $(2y)^y = y^{2y}$. Simplifying this gives us $2^y * y^y = y^{2y}$. Since $y \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $y^y$ to get $2^y = y^y$. Taking the logarithm base 2 on both sides gives us $y = log_2(y^y)$. Using the property of logarithms, we rewrite the right side as $y*log_2(y)$. So our equation now is $y = y*log_2(y)$. Dividing both sides by y gives us $1 = log_2(y)$. This implies that $y = 2$. Substituting $y = 2$ back into the equation $x = 2y$ gives us $x = 2*2 = 4$. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x = 4$ and $y = 2$.

So, we can find the fifth term as follows:\n$$a_5 = \\frac{1}{2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{5-1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{1}{256}$$\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is $S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number. So, we can find the sum of the first ten terms as follows:\n$$S_{10} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 1}(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{10})}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{10}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{10}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical values:\n$$\\begin{aligned} a_5 &= \\frac{1}{256} \\\\ S_{10} &= \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{10}\\right) \\approx 0.3472 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo, the fifth term is $\\frac{1}{256}$ and the sum of the first ten terms is approximately $0.3472$.

    "question": "Express $30^{\\circ}12'36''$ in radians.",
    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To express an angle in radians, we need to convert degrees, minutes, and seconds into their respective radian equivalents. We know that 1 degree is equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radians, so 30 degrees would be $30 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians. Similarly, 1 minute is equal to $\\frac{1}{60}$ of a degree, which is also equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{10800}$ radians. Therefore, 12 minutes would be $12 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{10800} = \\frac{\\pi}{900}$ radians. Finally, 1 second is equal to $\\frac{1}{3600}$ of a minute, which is also equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{6480000}$ radians. Therefore, 36 seconds would be $36 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6480000} = \\frac{\\pi}{180000}$ radians.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have the angle and the distance from the observer to the base of the hill. We can set up the equation:\n\n$$\\tan(7') = \\frac{h}{540}$$\n\nwhere $h$ is the height of the hill. To find the value of $\\tan(7')$, we can use a calculator or look it up in a table of trigonometric values. Using a calculator, we find that $\\tan(7') \\approx 0.0029$. Now we can solve for $h$:\n\n$$0.0029 = \\frac{h}{540}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 540, we get:\n\n$$h \\approx 0.0029 \\times 540 \\approx 1.566$$\n\nSo the height of the hill is approximately 1.566 kilometers.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: To expand $(2x^2 - \\frac{1}{x^2})^8$, we can use the binomial theorem which states that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ and non-negative integer $n$:\n\n$(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\nIn this case, $a = 2x^2$, $b = -\\frac{1}{x^2}$, and $n = 8$. We want to find the first four terms of the expansion, so we will calculate $\\binom{8}{k} (2x^2)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nFor $k = 0$, we have $\\binom{8}{0} (2x^2)^8 (-\\frac{1}{x^2})^0 = 1 \\cdot 256x^{16}$.\n\nFor $k = 1$, we have $\\binom{8}{1} (2x^2)^7 (-\\frac{1}{x^2})^1 = 8 \\cdot 128x^{12} \\cdot -\\frac{1}{x^2} = -1024x^{10}$.\n\nFor $k = 2$, we have $\\binom{8}{2} (2x^2)^6 (-\\frac{1}{x^2})^2 = 28 \\cdot 64x^8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^4} = 1792x^4$.\n\nFor $k = 3$, we have $\\binom{8}{3} (2x^2)^5 (-\\frac{1}{x^2})^3 = 56 \\cdot 32x^6 \\cdot -\\frac{1}{x^6} = -704$.\n\nSo, the first four terms of the expansion are $256x^{16}$, $-1024x^{10}$, $1792x^4$, and $-704$.

In this case, we have $(k - x/3)^7 = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k} k^{7-k} (-x/3)^k$. We want to find the coefficient of $k^3$ when $k=1$, so we substitute $k=1$ into the expression and simplify:\n\n$(1 - x/3)^7 = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k} 1^{7-k} (-x/3)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k} (-x/3)^k$\n\nThe coefficient of $k^3$ is given as $560$, which means ${7 \\choose 3} (-x/3)^3 = 560$. Solving for $x$, we get:\n\n${7 \\choose 3} (-x/3)^3 = 560 \\Rightarrow 35(-x/3)^3 = 560 \\Rightarrow (-x/3)^3 = 16 \\Rightarrow -x/3 = 2 \\Rightarrow x = -6$\n\nNow we can expand $(k - x/3)^7$ up to the fourth term using the binomial theorem:\n\n$(k - x/3)^7 = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k} k^{7-k} (-x/3)^k = {7 \\choose 0} k^7 + {7 \\choose 1} k^6 (-x/3) + {7 \\choose 2} k^5 (-x/3)^2 + {7 \\choose 3} k^4 (-x/3)^3 + ...$\n\nSubstituting $x=-6$:\n\n$(k + 2)^7 = {7 \\choose 0} k^7 + {7 \\choose 1} k^6 (2) + {7 \\choose 2} k^5 (4) + {7 \\choose 3} k^4 (-8) + ...$\n\nExpanding further:\n\n$= k^7 + 14k^6 + 84k^5 - 224k^4 + ...$\n\nSo, the expansion up to the fourth term is $k^7 + 14k^6 + 84k^5 - 224k^4$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\begin{final}k^7 + 14k^6 + 84k^5 - 224k^4\\end{final}}$.",

The height, radius, and slant height form a right triangle, so we have $(12)^2 + (5)^2 = l^2$, where $l$ is the slant height. Simplifying gives us $144 + 25 = l^2$, so $l^2 = 169$.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $h$: $h = \\frac{3V}{\\pi r^2}$.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a right circular cone is $S = \\pi r l$, where $l$ is the slant height of the cone.

    "generated_answer": "Explanation: First we calculate the radius of the inner sphere using the given dimensions of the shell. Then we can find its volume and subtract from that of the cube to get the volume of the hollow space.\nLet r be the radius of the inner sphere. Given the thickness of the shell is 2 cm,\nthe diameter of the outer sphere is 15 cm, so the diameter of the inner sphere is 15 - 2 * 2 = 11 cm. Hence, r = 11 / 2 = 5.5 cm.\nNow consider the cube. Since the solid sphere fits into the cube, the side length of the cube equals the diameter of the outer sphere, which is 15 cm. Therefore, the volume of the cube is 15^3 = 3375 cm^3.\nFinally, let's compute the volume V of the inner sphere. Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, namely V = 4/3 π r^3, where r = 5.5 cm, we have\nV = 4/3 π (5.5)^3 = 4/3 π * 166.375 = 221.809 cm^3.\nHence, the volume of the hollow space inside the box is 3375 - 221.809 = 3153.191 cm^3.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{<final>3153.191</final>}$.",

The answer is \\frac{26{101},(5)/(16)}$"
