The ratio of diameters is 28:35, so the ratio of revolutions is 35:28, which simplifies to 5:4. To cover the same distance, the front wheel will revolve more than the back wheel. The exact number of revolutions can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the circumference of each wheel and then taking the ratio. The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\times 28$ and the back wheel is $2\\pi \\times 35$. The ratio of distances covered per revolution is the same as the ratio of their circumferences, which is 28:35 or 4:5.

To find the area of the field excluding the road, we must first understand the relationship between the field and the road. The road surrounds the field, forming a border of uniform width. This means the total area (field + road) is a larger square, and the field itself is a smaller square inside. The area of the road is the difference between the area of the larger square and the smaller square. Since the road is 4 meters wide, the side length of the larger square is 4 meters more than the side length of the smaller square. Let the side length of the field be $ x $. Then, the side length of the larger square is $ x + 8 $. The area of the road is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the field:  \n$$\n(x + 8)^2 - x^2 = 1 \\text{ hectare}\n$$  \nSimplifying:  \n$$\nx^2 + 16x + 64 - x^2 = 1 \\text{ hectare} \\Rightarrow 16x + 64 = 1 \\text{ hectare}\n$$  \nSolving for $ x $:  \n$$\n16x = -63 \\Rightarrow x = -3.9375\n$$  \nThis result is not feasible because the side length cannot be negative.

This distance corresponds to the arc length of a 60° angle in a circle. Using the formula for arc length $s = r\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is in radians, we convert 60° to radians: $60^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians. Solving for radius $r = \\frac{s}{\\theta} = \\frac{0.6}{\\pi/3} \\approx 0.573$ km. The diameter is twice the radius, so $2 \\times 0.573 = 1.146$ km, which is approximately 1145.9 meters. Therefore, the diameter of the circular track is approximately 114.59 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

    "raw_output": "The outer dimensions of the box are 1.6 m (length), 1.2 m (breadth), and 0.8 m (height). Since the wood is 3 cm (0.03 m) thick, the inner dimensions are reduced by twice the thickness on each side. Therefore, the inner length = 1.6 - 2×0.03 = 1.54 m, inner breadth = 1.2 - 2×0.03 = 1.14 m, and inner height = 0.8 - 2×0.03 = 0.74 m. The inner surface area is calculated as 2(lb + bh + lh) = 2(1.54×1.14 + 1.14×0.74 + 1.54×0.74) = 2(1.7556 + 0.8436 + 1.1416) = 2(3.7408) = 7.48 m². The cost of painting is 7.48 × 14.44 = 108.  \n\nExplanation: The inner surface area is calculated by reducing the outer dimensions by twice the wood thickness and then applying the surface area formula.

The outer diameter of the hollow iron sphere is 15 cm, and the thickness is 2 cm, meaning the inner diameter is 11 cm. The volume of the hollow space is the volume of the cube minus the volume of the solid sphere. The cube's side length is equal to the outer diameter of the sphere, which is 15 cm. The volume of the cube is $15^3 = 3375$ cubic cm. The volume of the solid sphere is $\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$, where $r = \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$ cm. Calculating this gives approximately 696.91 cubic cm. Subtracting this from the cube's volume gives the hollow space volume of approximately 2678.09 cubic cm. However, this does not match any of the answer choices. Re-evaluating the problem, it seems the hollow space is actually the volume of the hollow part of the sphere, which is the volume of the outer sphere minus the volume of the inner sphere.
