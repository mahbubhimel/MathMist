The ground truth provides numerical values. To check equivalence, we simplify the student's expressions:\n\nFirst expression: $\\frac{32(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\\sqrt{3}}{1}$  \nSimplify: $32(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\\sqrt{3} = 32(3 - \\sqrt{3}) = 96 - 32\\sqrt{3}$  \nNumerically: $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$, so $32(3 - 1.732) = 32(1.268) \\approx 40.576$ meters.\n\nSecond expression: $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\\sqrt{3}}$  \nSimplify: $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$  \nRationalize denominator: $\\frac{32}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{32(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{32(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 16(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$  \nNumerically: $16(1.732 + 1) = 16(2.732) \\approx 43.712$ meters.\n\nHowever, the ground truth is 27.71 meter, 16 meter. These do not match the simplified student expressions. The student's expressions evaluate to approximately 40.576 and 43.712, which are not equivalent to the ground truth values.\n\nStep"
