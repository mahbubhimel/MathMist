However, if the student intended to write $\\frac{1}{a + b + c}$ due to a formatting error, then it would be equivalent.\n\nStep 3: Check for mathematical equivalence using appropriate methods.  \nIf the student answer is interpreted as $\\frac{1}{a + b + c}$, then it is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth. However, the formatting suggests a possible misinterpretation where the numerator is $1 \\times (a + b + c)$, which would be $a + b + c$, making the expression $\\frac{a + b + c}{1}$, which is not equivalent.\n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.  \nThe formatting issue in the student answer could lead to a different interpretation, which would not be equivalent to the ground truth.\n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.  \nGiven the potential formatting ambiguity, there is a possibility of misinterpretation, but if the student intended to write $\\frac{1}{a + b + c}$, then it would be equivalent.
