This results in 68.5/101, which is not an integer. However, 137 and 202 are both divisible by 2, so 137/202 = 68.5/101. This is not equivalent to 26/101.  \n\nStep 4: Note any fundamental differences in mathematical meaning.  \nThe fractions 26/101 and 137/202 are not equivalent.  \n\nStep 5: Make final decision with confidence assessment.  \nThe fractions are not mathematically equivalent.",
