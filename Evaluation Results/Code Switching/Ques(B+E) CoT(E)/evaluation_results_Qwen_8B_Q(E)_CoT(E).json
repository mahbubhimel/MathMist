Count the number of such pairs. Then the answer is 2. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the relation in terms of the number of elements in the relation. So the relation R has two elements. Therefore, the answer is 2. Yes, that seems plausible. So the final answer would be 2. But I need to make sure that the problem is indeed asking for the count.

        "tag is placed correctly. </think> Problem statement: Express $10^{5}$ in ordinary decimal form. Problem understanding: The task is to convert the exponential expression $10^{5}$ into its standard decimal representation. Mathematical analysis: The expression $10^{n}$ represents a 1 followed by $n$ zeros in decimal form. This is a direct consequence of the base-10 numbering system. Step-by-step solution: 1. Recognize that $10^{5}$ means multiplying 10 by itself 5 times: $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10$. 2. Simplify the multiplication step-by-step: - $10 \\times 10 = 100$ (two zeros), - $100 \\times 10 = 1,000$ (three zeros), - $1,000 \\times 10 = 10,000$ (four zeros), - $10,000 \\times 10 = 100,000$ (five zeros). 3. Conclude that $10^{5} = 100,000$. Verification: The pattern of adding a zero for each multiplication by 10 confirms the result. Counting the zeros in 100,000 matches the exponent 5, ensuring correctness. Final Answer: 100000 <final>100000"
