Problem understanding: The task is to compute the square of the binomial $2a + 3b$ by applying the appropriate algebraic identity. Mathematical analysis: The square of a binomial $(x + y)^2$ is given by the formula: $$ (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 $$ Here, $x = 2a$ and $y = 3b$. Substituting these into the formula will yield the expanded form. Step-by-step solution: 1. Apply the binomial square formula: $$ (2a + 3b)^2 = (2a)^2 + 2 \\cdot (2a) \\cdot (3b) + (3b)^2 $$ 2. Compute each term: - $(2a)^2 = 4a^2$ - $2 \\cdot (2a) \\cdot (3b) = 12ab$ - $(3b)^2 = 9b^2$ 3. Combine the terms: $$ 4a^2 + 12ab + 9b^2 $$ Verification: Expanding $(2a + 3b)(2a + 3b)$ manually confirms the result: $$ 2a \\cdot 2a + 2a \\cdot 3b + 3b \\cdot 2a + 3b \\cdot 3b = 4a^2 + 12ab + 9b^2 $$ The calculation is consistent.

Problem understanding: The expression for $ X $ involves reciprocal terms and requires simplification by combining fractions. Mathematical analysis: To simplify $ X $, rewrite the terms with negative exponents as fractions, find a common denominator, and compute the reciprocal. Step-by-step solution: 1. Rewrite $ 2a^{-1} $ and $ 3b^{-1} $ as fractions: $ (2)/(a) + (3)/(b) $. 2. Combine the fractions by finding the common denominator $ ab $: $ (2b + 3a)/(ab) $. 3. Take the reciprocal of the combined fraction: $ X = (ab)/(2b + 3a) $. Verification: The steps correctly simplify the expression by combining terms and inverting the result. Final Answer: $ (ab)/(3a + 2b) $ <final>$(ab)/(3a + 2b)"

Problem understanding: Find values of $ x $ and $ y $ that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of $ y $: $$ 2(2x + y) = 2(8) \\implies 4x + 2y = 16 $$ 2. Add the modified first equation to the second equation to eliminate $ y $: $$ (4x + 2y) + (3x - 2y) = 16 + 5 \\implies 7x = 21 $$ 3. Solve for $ x $: $$ x = (21)/(7) = 3 $$ Substitute $ x = 3 $ into the first original equation: $$ 2(3) + y = 8 \\implies 6 + y = 8 \\implies y = 2 $$ Verification: Substituting $ x = 3 $ and $ y = 2 $ into both equations confirms they are satisfied.

Problem understanding: Find all real numbers $ y $ such that when 3 is subtracted from $ y $, the result is less than 5. Mathematical analysis: This is a linear inequality. To solve for $ y $, isolate it by performing inverse operations on both sides of the inequality. Addition is the inverse of subtraction, so adding 3 to both sides will isolate $ y $. Step-by-step solution: 1. Start with the inequality: $ y - 3 < 5 $. 2. Add 3 to both sides to isolate $ y $: $ y - 3 + 3 < 5 + 3 $. 3. Simplify both sides: $ y < 8 $. Verification: Testing $ y = 5 $: $ 5 - 3 = 2 < 5 $ (valid). Testing $ y = 8 $: $ 8 - 3 = 5 $, which is not less than 5 (invalid). Testing $ y = 9 $: $ 9 - 3 = 6 $, which is not less than 5 (invalid).
